All, Ohh. Ouch. 
Rachel," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? "
Monica," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will"

Phoebe," Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know"
Monica, We're with you. We got it.

Monica, Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..
Ross, What? 
Monica," ..I dunno, a little too Alan? "

Ross," Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. "
Joey," Oh, (Imitating Ross) ""you do, do you""? "
Ross," You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. "

Monica," Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
Chandler," No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting"
Joey," Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. "
Phoebe," You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
Chandler," Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. "
Phoebe," No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. "

Rachel," Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
Ross," Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry"
Rachel, Who?
Ross," Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you"
Rachel, Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Ross," Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat"

Mr. Geller, What's the score?
Joey, Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Mr. Geller, Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
Rachel," (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
Mrs. Geller, (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.
Monica," Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
Mrs. Geller," No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',"
Monica, That sounds like Nana.
Mrs. Geller, Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
Monica, ...I can imagine.
Mrs. Geller," I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the"

Monica, Huh.
Mrs. Geller," More wine, dear?"
Monica," Oh, I think so."
Mrs. Geller," (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)"
Monica, Thank you. They're yours.

Chandler," Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,"
Lowell, I know. That's what I told her.
Chandler, Really.
Lowell, Yeah.
Chandler, So- you can tell?
Lowell," Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar."
Chandler," So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
Lowell," Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend"
Chandler, He is?

Phoebe, Hey.
Chandler, And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Joey," Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
Chandler," That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey"
Phoebe, What were you modeling for?
Joey, You know those posters for the city free clinic?

Monica," So you're free Thursday, then."
Phoebe," Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
Monica," Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"

Susan," Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."

Susan," Yeah, yeah, all the time."
Ross, Really?
Susan," But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
[Scene," Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]"
Ross," Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly"
Phoebe," Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can"
Chandler," I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,"
Monica," Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
Rachel," No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,"
Monica," Rach, here's your mail."
Rachel," Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
Monica," (insistently) No, here's your mail."
Rachel," Thanks, you can just put it on the table."

Girl," Yeah, right."
Joey, I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.

Rachel, We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica, No I don't.
Rachel," Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""

Monica, Can you go any faster with that?
Joey," Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
Monica, Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Chandler, (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
Rachel," (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't"

Chandler, Shall I carve?
Rachel, By all means.
Chandler," Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
Ross, I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Monica, (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?

Joey, Shut up!
Chandler, We're not—we're not saying anything.
Phoebe, What?
Ross, Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Joey, Thank you.
Chandler," (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright..."
Joey," There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
Ross," Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
Chandler, And then he did.
Rachel," Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
Phoebe," Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of"
Ross," No, women are welcome to play."
Phoebe," Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some"
Chandler, There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Joey," Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
Girls," Oh, yeah, right."
Monica," Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
Rachel, Really.
Monica," I mean, that's a typical guy response."
Ross," Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
Girls, No.
Rachel, But you could teach us.
Guys, No.
[Scene," Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]"
Chandler," (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards."
Monica," So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
Rachel," Oh, good for you!"
Phoebe, Congratulations!
Chandler," OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
Phoebe," OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
Ross," No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't—you can't do..."
Rachel," Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)"
Ross," No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that."
Rachel," Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for"
Ross," Oh, you're... (gives up)"

Phoebe," But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
Chandler," OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two"
Monica," (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
Phoebe, (to Joey)
Joey, About what?
Phoebe, About how good your cards were.
Joey, Heh... I was bluffing.
Phoebe, A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Rachel," OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before"
Guys," Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Chandler," Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
Rachel, Settle what?
Chandler," The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us"
Ross," The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
Rachel, Oh. Right.
Joey," You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget"
Monica," Hell no, we'll pay!"
Phoebe," OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
Monica, And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross, Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Rachel, (to Ross)
Ross, (pause)...Yeah.
Chandler," Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them"

Carol, My breast milk is gross?
Susan, This should be fun.
Ross," No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think"

CHANDLER," If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook,"
MONICA, You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
CHANDLER, Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with
RACHEL," Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone"
MONICA, You are not a freak. You're a guy.
RACHEL, She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.

PHOEBE," Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished"
MR A," Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that"
PHOEBE, Everything?
MR A, Everything.
PHOEBE," Whoa, that's a lot of stuff."
MR A," Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time."
PHOEBE," I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head."
MR A," [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?"
MRS GREEN, Look at this.

RACHEL, God!
MONICA," All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. "
MRS GREEN," That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?"
RACHEL, Oh! What's new in sex?
MRS GREEN, The only man I've ever been with is your father.
MONICA," I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything."
MRS GREEN," I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there"
RACHEL," Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean,"
MRS GREEN, No.
RACHEL, You want me to talk you out of it?
MRS GREEN, No.
RACHEL, Then what? What do you want?
MRS GREEN, I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
RACHEL, Why on earth would I understand this?
MRS GREEN, You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
RACHEL, Oh.
MONICA," All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes"

CAROL, You do?
ROSS," Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this."

Ross, Put it back exactly where you found it?
Chandler, Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found
Ross," ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping."
Chandler, She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Ross," Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?"
Chandler," She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
Ross," Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move"

Monica, (on phone) Hi!
Chandler," Hey Mon, how's it going?"
Monica," Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself."
Chandler," Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
Monica, It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm
Chandler, No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.

Ross," Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue."
Chandler," Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we"
Ross," Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either."
Chandler," Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that."
Ross," Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science."
Chandler, That's not specific to girls.
Joey," This is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
Ross," Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
Chandler, And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ross, They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Chandler," Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
Ross, (nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.

Rachel," Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because"
Phoebe, So?
Rachel," Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy."
Phoebe, Why do you care?
Rachel, Because they're people.
Phoebe, But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Rachel," Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes."
Phoebe," Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,"
Rachel," I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,"

Monica, Yeah. 
Rachel," When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount"
Phoebe," Oh, I'd say about a month. "
Monica, Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
Joey, Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
Rachel, Interesting. 
Monica," When it's your assistant, I would say never. "
Joey," All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because"
Rachel, Huh. A moo-point? 
Joey," Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. "
Rachel," (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did"
Monica," Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s"
Rachel," You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. "

Rachel, How are you holding up? 
Tag, Not bad. 
Rachel, Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
Tag, Thanks. 
Rachel, So were you guys together a long time? 
Tag, A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. 
Rachel, Now that she broke up with you? 
Tag, Yeah. 
Rachel, Yeah. Hmmmm. 
Tag," It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in"
Rachel," No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know"
Tag, Why? 
Rachel," Because, uh—it has to. "
Tag," You have all the answers, don't you? "
Rachel," Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. "
Tag," Hey, thanks for talking to me. "

Rachel," No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what"
Tag, Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)

Phoebe," Yeah, okay. "
Monica, Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to

Ross, Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
Chandler," Well, I, I should go in there. "
Ross," No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. "
Chandler, Why not? 
Ross, Because you sent away the dog!

Tag," Um, I'm not. "
Rachel," Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. "
Tag," No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that"
Rachel, Really? 
Tag," Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her) "
Rachel," Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. "

Ross, Right.
Phoebe," Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?"
Ross," No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is"
Rachel, Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Ross, And smart!
Rachel, Popular.
Ross, With an aptitude for science.
Phoebe, Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking
Rachel, Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!
Ross, Really? Me too!
Phoebe, Me too!
Rachel, Really?!
Phoebe," Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!"
Ross," Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach,"
Rachel," Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s"
Ross, Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Rachel," Okay fine, what do you have?"
Ross," Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there,"
Rachel," Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard."
Phoebe," Yeah, by Sandrine."
Ross, You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Rachel," I’m really, really not."
Phoebe, How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Ross, All right.
Rachel, All right.
Ross, That sounds fair.
Rachel," Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check"
Ross, Veto.
Rachel, Why?
Ross," Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out"
Phoebe, I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Ross," Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?"
Rachel," Ross, why do you hate our child?"
Ross," Fine, you go."
Rachel," Okay, James."
Ross, Huh.
Rachel, But only if it’s a girl.
Ross," Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?"
Rachel, Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Ross, Veto. Stewart?
Rachel, Veto. Sawyer?
Ross, Veto. Helen?
Rachel, Veto.

Chandler, What is it?
Monica, I drew you a bath!
Chandler," Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having"
Monica," Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff!"
Chandler," Well, this does butch it up a bit."
Monica," I swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
Chandler," All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
Monica, Absolutely.
Monica, Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.
Chandler," (thinking) All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower"
Monica, (entering) So?

Dr. Long," Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing"
Ross," Uh, no. No, we’re not."
Rachel, But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether
Dr. Long, That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…
Ross," No, no, we want to wait, right?"
Rachel, Right. Right.
Dr. Long," (looks at her beeping pager) Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I know"
Rachel," (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these"
Ross," What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible!"
Rachel, Third one from the left?
Ross," Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it."
Rachel, What?! 
Ross, You’re looking!
Rachel, I didn’t!
Ross, I saw you!
Rachel," Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear."
Ross, Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Rachel," Okay, but Ross just listen to me…"
Ross," No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!"
Rachel," But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I"
Ross, Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?
Rachel," (holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross."
[Scene," Chandler and Monica’s, Monica is entering.]"

Chandler," I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s"
Monica, You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here. 
Chandler, I’m in the bathtub.
Monica, Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?
Chandler," I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt"
Monica, What?
Chandler, The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.
Monica," Okay, let’s talk about something else."
Chandler," Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!"
Monica," Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking"
Chandler, I had the exact same conversation.
Monica, You did? What was he talking about?
Chandler, I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out
Monica, (groans) That was a long night.
Chandler," All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"
Monica," Okay, he was talking about rules."
Chandler, Uh-huh.
Monica," Umm, and looking at people differently."
Chandler, He didn’t say anything about that to me.
Monica, What did he tell you?
Chandler," He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of"
Monica," Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants"
Chandler, But what did he mean by rules?
Monica, Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Chandler, Because he was looking at her differently.
Monica," And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
Chandler, My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Phoebe, (from outside the bathroom) You guys?
Monica, Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!
Chandler, You don’t say anything.
Monica, Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the
Chandler, I’m not going to let you say anything.
Monica, You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)
Chandler," Oh, God!"
Phoebe," Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron."
Monica," Oh, you had that? "
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Monica," I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago."
Phoebe," Oh, just as well, I broke this one."
Phoebe, What?
Monica, Nothing.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica," I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not"
Phoebe, Fine.
Monica, It’s a humdinger!
Phoebe, Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
Monica, Somebody likes you!
Phoebe, (Groans) Is it Chandler?
Monica, No!
Phoebe," Well, then tell him to stop staring!"
Monica, It’s Joey!
Phoebe, Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
Monica, Is it something you’d be interested in?
Phoebe," I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean,"
Monica," I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?"
Phoebe," Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt."
Monica," Not Chandler, just Joey."
Phoebe, Sure.

PHOEBE, All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)  Hello?  Hi.  I'm sorry 
MIKE, All right.  I'll do it.  (Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)  
PHOEBE," (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.  Bye."
MIKE, Hey buddy.
ROSS," Uh, hi."
MIKE," Um, can I come back in?"

CHANDLER," (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
MONICA, (gasp) Chandler!  You're home!
CHANDLER," That's right.  You're husband's home.  So, now the sex can stop."
MONICA, What are you saying?
CHANDLER, Joey said that you're in here with another man.
MONICA, There's no man in here.  How dare you accuse me of that.  (She slaps 
JOEY," All right.  All right.  Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend "
CHANDLER, (To Monica) What is he doing?
MONICA, (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
JOEY," (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."
CHANDLER," All right.  Well, I'll check the guest room."
JOEY, (sniffing the air and then Monica.)  Why do I smell men's cologne?
MONICA, (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.
JOEY, (sniffs his shirt.)  Oh yeah.  I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
CHANDLER, There's nobody here Joe.
JOEY, I guess not.
MONICA, I can't believe you thought I was cheating.  (pointing at Joey) You

MONICA, I don't know what to say.  We shouldn't have lied to you.

JOEY," (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know "
CHANDLER, I'm sorry.  That's the one thing I can't do.  I promised I'd be with

MONICA, (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.

MIKE, It's true.  I did.

[Scene," Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone's there; Phoebe recites the last verse of a poem to Joey. This poem is known as ""The Night Before Christmas"" by Clement Clarke Moore, but it seems that it's rather ""Account of a visit from St. Nicholas"" by Henry Livingston.]"
Phoebe," ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
Joey," (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?"
Phoebe, (smiling) Uh-huh.
Chandler," (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
Monica, I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Ross, You're really not coming back?
Chandler," Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
Monica," It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
Chandler," So, who does?"
Phoebe," Oh, I like my job."
Joey, I *love* my job.
Rachel," Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
Ross, I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Chandler," I'm sorry, I won't be here."
Monica," It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
Chandler, Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
Monica, (shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Chandler, Did I not mention that?
Monica, No!
Chandler," (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming"
[Scene," Chandler's Office in Tulsa, in the conference room. Chandler's staff/co-workers are sitting round the table; Chandler is walking around, when he notices a piece of paper attached to the back of his chair.]"
Chandler," All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler."
Wendy, Hey!
Others, Hey.
Chandler, Hey. Where've you been?
Wendy," I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)"
Chandler," (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
Claudia, My kid's in a play right now.
Chandler," Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
Ken," (reading off his card) ""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet""."
Chandler," Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
Wendy, *Now* it feels like Christmas.
Chandler," I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
Ken, You can come to my house!
Chandler," Haha, no thanks!"
Wendy, That was a nice pep-talk.
Chandler," Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
Wendy," So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?"
Chandler," Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
[Scene," Central Perk, Phoebe is singing her holiday song.]"
Phoebe," So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing"
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel enter.]"
Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
Chandler," I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
Phoebe," Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
Rachel, We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler, What? That's terrible!
Phoebe," No-no, we do it every year!"
Chandler," Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
Phoebe," No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
Rachel," Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
Chandler," No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Phoebe," Oh no, we have to!"
Chandler," No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
Phoebe," Well then, you should look with us."
Chandler, Why?
Rachel," Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
Chandler," No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
Phoebe," Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah."
Rachel," Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
Chandler," If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
Rachel, That's right!
Phoebe," Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
Rachel," Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
Rachel, Oh.
Phoebe," Ooh, who's it for?"
Rachel," (Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) ""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S."
[Scene, Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Chandler are giving out their Christmas presents out of a cardboard box from a case of motor oil.]
Joey," Rach, these are for you."
Rachel, Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Joey," No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
Chandler," OK, Pheebs, your turn."
Phoebe," Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
Joey, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, You guuuyys.
Joey," And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
Ross, You got me a cola drink?
Chandler," And, a lemon lime."
Ross," Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
Chandler, And last but not least.
Joey, They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
[Scene," Monica, Chandler and Phoebe's, Ross is costumed as an Armadillo.]"
Ross," Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?"
Ben, Cool!
Ross, Yeah!
Monica, Come on Ben.
Ross, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler," (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
Ben, Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
Chandler, Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Ross," What are you doing here, Santa?"
Chandler," Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
Ross," I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
Chandler, What?
Monica," Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say."
Ross, (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Chandler," You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
Ross," Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
Chandler, Why?
Ross," Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
Chandler, But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross," I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
Chandler," Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Monica," (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
Chandler, Santa? Really?
Monica," Yeah, is that okay?"
Chandler, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
[Scene, Back in the conference room in Tulsa.]
Chandler," You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
Chandler," Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
Chandler," Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?"
Wendy, Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
Chandler, Ah. Thanks.
Wendy," Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham."
Chandler, Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
[Scene change back an forth," Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica's on the other end of the line. The phone's speaker is turned on, so the rest of the gang, sitting around the phone, can hear Chandler.]"
Monica, Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Others, (simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)
Phoebe, (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
Chandler," Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
Monica, So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Chandler," Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
Monica, Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Chandler, It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Monica," Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?"
Chandler, I sent them home.
Monica," Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?"
Chandler," Uhh, uh..."
Ross," (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!"
Chandler, I don't know!
Ross," (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!"
Chandler," I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
Monica, What does she do there?
Chandler," Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
Monica, She did WHAT?
Chandler, BE-LOW me!
Joey," Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"
Monica, *What*??
Chandler," Well, she... she didn't win..."
Monica," Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work."
Chandler," Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
Rachel," (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!"
Chandler," Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, I'm serious!
Monica, Okay!
Chandler, Merry Christmas.
Monica, Merry Christmas.
Chandler," Merry Christmas, you guys!"
Others," (simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)"
Phoebe," (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab."
[Scene, back in the conference room in Tulsa]
Chandler," (hanging up the phone) The wife says ""Hi!""."
Wendy, Ah. Fun conversation?
Chandler," Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
Wendy," Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)"
Chandler," This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
[Scene," The conference room in Tulsa again, Chandler is trying to evade Wendy]"
Chandler," Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)"
Wendy, (laughs) ...Missy?
Chandler, I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Wendy," You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)"
Chandler," (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!"
Wendy, So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)
Chandler, I'm *happily* married.
Wendy, Oh. - What's *that* like?
Chandler," Right. So, I'm sorry..."
Wendy," Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?"
Chandler," Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case"
Wendy," Okay, let me ask you something"
[Scene," London, Chandler's hotel room. He was getting ready for bed when Monica pays him a visit and they started talking]"
Chandler," I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
Monica, Really?
Chandler, You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica," Well, not anymore."
Chandler, But we don't do that.
Monica," I know, I just thought it would be fun."
Chandler, How drunk are you?
Monica, Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler, (thinks) That's the perfect amount!
Monica, Okay!
Monica, (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
Chandler, What?
Monica, This doesn't feel weird!
Chandler, I know.
Monica, You're a really good kisser.
Chandler," Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?"
Monica, Hm-hmm!
Chandler, Okay!
Monica, Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler, It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica, We're gonna see each other naked.
Chandler, Yep!
Monica, Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler, Count of three?
Monica, One!
Chandler, Two!
Monica, Two!
Both," Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)"
Chandler, Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica," Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
Chandler, Eh! (They start making out again)
[Scene," A hallway in the hospital, Monica and Chandler are talking.]"
Chandler," So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
Monica," Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him."
Chandler," Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
Monica, I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler," Really? Okay, so..."
Monica, (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Chandler," Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Monica," Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around"
Chandler, Right!
[Scene," The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]"
Monica," I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
Chandler," Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
Monica, You're so efficient. I love you!
Chandler, Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Monica," No-no-no, wait! We need something old!"
Chandler," Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
Monica, That'll work!
Chandler, I don't think so.
Monica," Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
Chandler, (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Monica, That's stealing!
Chandler," No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
Monica, Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Chandler," Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)"
[Scene," Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]"
Monica," Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
Chandler, Ehh.
Monica," Eh, you work for that."
Chandler," Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
Monica, You do?!
Chandler," Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
Monica," Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
Chandler," Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
Monica, You thought about that?
Chandler, Yeah.
Monica, How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler," Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
Monica, What else did you think about?
Chandler," Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Monica," (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
Chandler, Sure you do.
Monica," No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage."
Chandler, You sure?
Monica, Uh-hmm.
Chandler, I love you so much.
Monica, I love you. (They kiss.)
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone except Chandler is there; they're opening their presents]"
Rachel," (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!"
Ross, Really? You're not gonna return it?
Rachel," Well, not this second!"
Phoebe," (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
Rachel," Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
Ross," Wow, it really is!"
Monica," ""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."
Phoebe, Aren't we done with that?
Monica," Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Oh my god...
Joey," Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
Monica, What are you doing here?
Chandler, I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Joey," Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
Chandler, Monica.
Joey, Got ya. (blinks an eye)
Chandler, I never want to leave you again!
Monica," But I thought if you left, you get fired."
Chandler, Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Monica, What?
Ross," What, you, you really quit your job?"
Chandler," Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
Rachel, What do you really want to do?
Chandler, (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
Monica, Oh my god!
Chandler," I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
Monica," No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
Chandler, Thanks!
Phoebe," Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
Chandler, (flattered) Ahh...
Phoebe, Now give me my real gift.
Phoebe, (to Chandler) Thank you.
Chandler," (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)"
Ross," Oh, hey..."
Ross," (reading off his card) ""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?"
Rachel, Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Chandler," I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
Joey, Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Chandler, I don't have a *job*!
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica is cleaning up, Chandler is sitting on the couch, checking the Job offers in a Newspaper.]"
Chandler," Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica"
Monica," You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?"

[Scene, Chandler and Monica's]
Chandler, Hey!
Monica," Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. "
Chandler, I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Monica," Well, I just lost my erection."
Chandler," I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself? "
Monica, You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Chandler, But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start. 
Monica," Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, "
Chandler, Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Monica, I know!!! My erection is back!

Joey, (To Gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) Thank you!
Phoebe," Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
Joey, Okay.
Joey,
Phoebe," I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash. "
Joey, If you want I could loan you some money?
Phoebe," Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."
Joey," Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?"
Phoebe, You could do that?
Joey," Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. "
Phoebe," Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!"
Joey," Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
Phoebe," Oh, really?"
Joey, No it is awesome!
Ross, Hi guys.
All, (Adlib hellos)
Phoebe," Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?"
Ross, Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Joey, She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Rachel," Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
Ross," I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts."
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's]
Monica," (Flipping through bunch of folders as Chandler enters from bathroom) Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, "
Chandler, How long was I in there?
Monica, Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Chandler, Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Monica, Don't you want to look through the rest?
Chandler," I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
Monica," You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!"
Chandler," I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your "
Monica," I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."""
Chandler, Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Monica, I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. 
Chandler," ""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
Monica," ""Marriage. It's not for everybody."""
[Scene, Ralph Lauren]
Rachel, That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 
Ross," Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. "
Rachel, I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (To the guy behind her desk) Who the hell are you!?
Guy, Who the hell are you?
Rachel, I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Ross," Good one, Rach."
Guy," I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job."
Rachel, Excuse me?
Gavin," Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?"
[Scene, DOOL set]
Phoebe," Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!"
Joey," Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. "
Phoebe, Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous. 
Joey," Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back."
Director," Okay, okay, okay! (To Phoebe) You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. "
Phoebe," Okay, now. What?"
Director, And...Action!!
Director, Cut! Cut!
Phoebe," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous."
Director," Well, don't be."
Phoebe," Okay, that helps."
Director, And...Action!
Director, Cut!
Joey," Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! (Off the director's look) Alright, eight."
Director, And...Action!
[Scene, Central Perk]
Interviewer," So, do you have any other question about advertising?"
Chandler," No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."""
Interviewer, Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
Chandler, Really? That's great!
Interviewer, It's an unpaid internship.
Chandler," It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
Interviewer, Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
Chandler," Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. "
Interviewer, Stop!
Interviewer, Okay.
[Scene, Ralph Lauren]
Rachel," Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
Gavin," Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job."
Rachel, A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
Gavin, Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
Rachel," Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. "
Gavin, I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
Rachel, Excuse me?
Ross, Rach we have a code brown situation.
Rachel," Can you please, please take care of it for me?"
Ross," Alright, but you have to do one sometime."
Rachel, Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Gavin," Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together."
Rachel, That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp. 
Gavin, I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
Rachel," Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?"
Gavin," Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit."
Rachel, Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Mr. Zelner," (Enters) Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas."
Rachel," Oh, hi Mr. Zelner."
Mr. Zelner," Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, "
Rachel," That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
Gavin," Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision."
Rachel," (To herself) Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power."
Mr. Zelner," Incidentally, when are you coming back?"
Rachel, Today.
Gavin, You said two weeks.
Rachel," No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
[Scene, DOOL set]
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe," Hey. So, what did he say?"
Joey," Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" "
"Okay, so he said"," ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."""
Phoebe," I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor."
Joey," That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray. "
Phoebe, Joey.
Joey," No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she"
Phoebe, Who dies?
Joey, (Points to man on operating table) Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Phoebe," Yes, doctor."
Joey, Okay.
Director," Okay, let's try this one more time. "
Phoebe," Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!"
Director, And...Action!
Phoebe," (Does the scene) Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?"
Director, The rest of the scene.
Phoebe," Okay, from the top, people!"
[Scene, Ralph Lauren]
Rachel," Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, "
Ross," What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
Rachel," Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now"
Ross, What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Rachel," I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?"
Ross, Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Rachel," Come on, I don't know what else to do."
Ross," Fine, fine. (To Emma) We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. (Gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)"
Rachel, Ross?
Ross, Huh?
Rachel, You're pretty.
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's] 
Chandler," Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. "
Ross, So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Chandler, Yeah. 
Ross, (Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.
Monica," (Enters) Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. (Sees Ross) Didn't see you there Geller. "
Chandler," Yeah, Ross is here so..."
Ross," Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?"
Monica, We're gonna have sex.
Ross, I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Monica, Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
Ross, Pants off Bing!
[Scene, Ralph Lauren]
Rachel," Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
Gavin," Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync."
Rachel," Hey, they were popular when I left!"
Gavin," Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow."
Rachel," Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
Gavin, That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
Rachel," Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, "
Gavin, Fine. 
Rachel, (Sits down in her chair) Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Gavin," Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out."
Rachel," Fine, I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it ""collapse"") Alright, fill me in! "
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's]
Ross, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Chandler," Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete "
Monica," (Enters from the bedroom) Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees."
Ross, Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Monica, (To Ross) Sorry. (To Chandler) But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Chandler," Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant. "
Monica, What are you talking about?
Chandler, That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Monica, What!? You faked it?
Ross," You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual (He leaves.)"
[Scene, DOOL set]
Phoebe," Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
Joey," Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay. "
Phoebe," Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress?"
Joey," Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
Phoebe," Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
Joey, Nice.
Phoebe, Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Joey," No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight. "
Phoebe, About what?
Joey, He slept with you and then never called you.
Phoebe, And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Director," Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!"
Man," So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me."
Joey/Drake," I'm surprised to, but yet here I am."
Director," Cut, cut! What are you doing!?"
Phoebe," Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
Extra, Me too!
Another extra, Me too!
Joey," Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!"
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's]
Gavin," (Enters) Wow, you're here already."
Rachel," Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but"
Gavin, How do you fix the chair?
Rachel," Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
Mr. Zelner," Good, because it's in ten minutes."
Rachel," What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
Mr. Zelner," Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going"
Rachel," Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, "
Gavin, You can do the presentation.
Rachel," No, I can't, I have a baby."
Gavin, I'll watch her.
Rachel, Why would you do that?
Gavin," Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy."
Rachel, That's really nice.
Gavin, I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Rachel," Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you."
Gavin," I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. (To Emma) Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you. "
[Scene, DOOL set]
Joey, Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Director," Okay, okay. But this is her last chance. "
Joey," Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
Joey," Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, "
Phoebe, I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Joey, You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Phoebe," Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened. "
Joey, What?
Phoebe," Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus"
Joey," (To the director) Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's]
Monica, You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
Chandler, Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises. 
Monica," Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
Chandler," That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby,"
Monica, Like a month?
Chandler, Or a year?
Monica," Really, you want to wait a year?"
Chandler," It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" (Pause)"
Monica, I really wanna have a baby.
Chandler," Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back. "
Monica," No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."
Chandler, I quit and you learn what I do?
Monica," It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. "
Chandler, I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
Monica," It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. "
Chandler, Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Monica," Yes, please!"
Chandler," Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time."
Monica, I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
[Closing credits][Scene, DOOL set]
Joey/Drake," I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. "
Man, I'm not your brother.
Phoebe/Waitress, What about my children Drake?! Huh!? (She starts running around on the set with a security guy chasing her) No!! No!! No! God!

Rachel, And Joey?
Joey, How do you think she's doing?

Rachel, Hello.
Gavin, Hello
Rachel," Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma "
Gavin, For what?
Rachel," Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous "
Gavin, Is this your first appology?
Rachel," No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And "
Heather, Good morning! 
Rachel," Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, "
Gavin, What?
Rachel, I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Gavin," I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her "
Rachel," Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
Gavin, Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
Rachel," Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at "
Gavin, I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Rachel, That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know 
Gavin, Huh. What's Tag's last name?
Rachel, It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last 
Gavin, But it was a deap meaningful relationship.

Joey," Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
Molly," You mean, when you were a baby."
Joey, Sure.
Monica, Would you stop staring at her?
Chandler, I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Monica, What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind 
Ross," Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there "
Chandler, Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Monica," Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl "
Molly, (to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Ross," Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you "
Molly, Bye

"Ross, Joey and Chandler"," Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma."
Rachel," (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if "

Chandler," Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? "
Ross," You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm "
Chandler," Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know "

Rachel, Really? What's that like?
Steve, It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's
Rachel (awkward chuckle)," Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something"
Steve, I do like my hair.
Rachel, Really? 
[Scene, Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are there. Phoebe's
Phoebe, Hello?
Rachel," Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
Phoebe," Hey, Rach!"
Rachel, This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Phoebe," You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. "
Rachel, I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Phoebe," Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
Rachel, He's not stoned.
Phoebe, Did he go out for a cigarette? 
Rachel," Yeah, four times."
Phoebe," My dear, sweet Rach."
Phoebe (to Joey)," Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable"
Joey," Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
Phoebe," By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny"
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's apartment. Emma has fallen
Monica, She's asleep. Chandler?
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler, Emma was doing it!
Monica, She's asleep.
Chandler," Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
Monica," Yes, but we have to be fast."
Chandler (laughs)," Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
Monica (laughs)," Okay, I'll try. "
Joey, Hello?
Joey, Emma? Hey! Hi!
Joey," How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the"
Joey," You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
[Scene, Delmonico's. Ross is still waiting for his date
Waiter, I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left. 
Ross," Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
Waiter," Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time."
Ross," Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to"
Waiter, Ooh... 
Ross, Just the crab cakes.
Waiter #2, What are you
Waiter," Just get out of here, okay?"
Ross, What's - what's going on?
Waiter," Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on"
Ross, What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Waiter," Well, if you stay till 9"
Ross, This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're done and
Monica," Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast."
Chandler, I think we may have really done it this time.
Monica," Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
Chandler, You may wanna get some more of those too.
Chandler, Where's Emma?
Monica," Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
Chandler," Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
Monica," Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma."
Chandler, Okay. (Runs out.)
Monica," Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,"
[Scene, The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and
Steve (sobbing), I - I can't believe I’m crying in front of you. You must
Rachel," No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry."
Steve, Really?
Rachel, Don't touch my coat!
Rachel," Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
Monica (on phone)," Hey, Rach, how's it going?"
Rachel," Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!"
Rachel (to Steve)," Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think"
Monica," Hey, did you stop by here?"
Rachel, No.
Monica," Oh my god, then..."
Monica," Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!"
Rachel," What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?"
Monica," Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just – she loves"
Monica (to Joey), Why the hell did you take her?
Joey, Because you two were having sex!
Monica," No, we weren't!"
Joey, Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)
Chandler," All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's"
Joey, Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in
Chandler," No, no, no."
Monica," No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
Joey," Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
Monica, Unless what?
Joey, Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Chandler, What? Why?
Joey," Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family"
Chandler, Your family name is Tribbiani.
Joey, (BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
[Scene, The street in front of Central Perk. Steve and
Rachel," Well, uh..."
Steve," Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you"
Rachel," Really, really not."
Steve," Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway."
Rachel," All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve."
Ross," Hey, what's wrong?"
Rachel, I just had a rough night.
Ross, Oh. Crab cake?
Rachel, Eww!
Ross," Well, what happened?"
Rachel," Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
Ross, Monica told me you had a blind date.
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross," I did, too."
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Rachel," Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
Ross, Why does everyone keep saying that?
Rachel," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown"
Ross, That bad?
Rachel," Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be"
Ross, Female body inspector? What size is that?
Phoebe," Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
Joey, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Joey," It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
Phoebe," Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
Phoebe," Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
Phoebe," Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
Ross," The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
Rachel," Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would"
Ross," Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's"
Joey," We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really"
Phoebe," Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
Phoebe," Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out."
Joey, Where?
Phoebe, Mexico!
[Scene, Delmonico's restaurant. Ross and Joey are sitting
Joey, Can you believe they're still not here?
Ross," I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the"
Joey," I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
Waiter, What?
Joey, We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.

Chandler," (excited) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…"
Joey," Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!"
Monica," (shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed) Let's get past the moment."
Phoebe, What's your news?
Chandler, Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)
Monica," (hugging Chandler) Oh, honey, that's incredible!"
Phoebe," (inquisitive) Gosh, what's the pay like? (Everybody stares at her indignantly) Oh, come on people… (defending) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (She looks at Joey) Hey Joey! (Joey winks at her)"
Chandler," Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship."
Joey," Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. "
Chandler," Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you. (Joey nods)"
Ross," So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
Chandler," Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
Phoebe, (enthusiastic) That's great.
Chandler," Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating "
Chandler, (grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!
Ross," You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising."
Monica," Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?"""
Ross," Yes, I did, I did! (He turns to Joey, disappointed) I should have written it down!"
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's Aparment, Monica sits at the table]"
Joey, (entering) Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Joey, Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (Monica smiles) ... and I smelled bacon. (taking some)
Monica, He just left.
Joey, (puzzled) Who did? (Monica looks bewildered)
Rachel, (entering) Joey! You never gonna believe it
Joey," (standing up, surprised) She did?"
Rachel, (enthusiastic) You got it!
Joey, (still surprised) I did?
Monica, What is she talking about?
Joey," I don't know, but it sounds great. "
Rachel, Your agent called. You got that audition.
Joey, With Lennart Haze?
Rachel, Yes.
Joey," Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time."
Monica, Is it a good play?
Joey," Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. "
Rachel," Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…"
Joey," Yeah, yeah, and directing."
Monica, (sighs) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. 
Rachel, (disbelieving) You saw that?
Monica," No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass."
Rachel and Joey," (pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces) Ah!"
Joey," Yeah, he's done some amazing works."
Rachel," Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. "
Joey, (almost laughing) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (They all laugh)
Monica, Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Joey, (sitting down) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
[Scene," Chandler's new workplace, his fellow interns are already seated around a table]"
Chandler," (entering) Good morning, everybody."
Intern," Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?"
Chandler," Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car."
Intern," Seriously, you're an intern?"
Chandler," Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
Intern, (shaking his head disbelievingly) Dude!
Chandler," Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down) "
Chandler, The comedian? USO?!
Intern," (correcting him) Uhm, it's USA, sir."
[Scene," Audition room, Joey is lead into the room by a receptionist in a fancy dress]"
Receptionist," This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze. "
Joey, It is so amazing to meet you. (They are shaking hands) I'm such a big fan of your work.
Lennart," Well, I've… I've been blessed with a… a lot of great roles. "
Joey," Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!"" "
Lennart," You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. (He stands up and walks menacingly towards Joey) I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service."
Joey," No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. "
Lennart, Really?
Joey, Yeah.
Lennart," Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role."
Joey, (regaining confidence) Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon…
Lennart," Peeeeeooooooooch (He mimes flying out of the cannon) ""Hang up that phone!"" One take!"
Joey, Wow!
Lennart," So, shall we read?"
Joey," Oh, yah, sure."
Lennart, Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it? 
Lennart," ""What the hell are you still doing here""?"
Joey," Err, ""I think you know"". "
Lennart," ""Bastard""!"
Joey," ""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."""
Lennart," ""Go, go!"""
Joey," ""I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."""
Lennart," I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say ""long pause"""
Joey," (understandingly) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a… (He mimes wearing a feather on his head)"
Lennart," No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you. "
Joey," Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern (He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent) ""I could go right now, maaan!"""
Lennart," (stunned, muttering) My god in heaven. "
Producer #1," Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?"
Lennart," You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. (Joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression). "
Lennart," Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. (Joey smiles smugly at this) This is a play. No, listen"
Joey," (interrupting their conversation) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also"
Lennart," Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?"
Joey, Yeah.
Lennart," Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much. "
Joey, I really doubt that. 
Lennart," (explaining to Joey, who nods fervently) No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you. "
Joey, (suggesting) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
[Scene," Backstreet, Ross and Phoebe walking]"
Phoebe," Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?"
Ross," Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. "
Phoebe," Oh, I hear divorce bells. "
Mugger, Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. 
Ross, (taken aback) What?
Mugger, I have a gun (It looks like he has a gun under his coat)
Ross," O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. (He searches his coat and freaks out). Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. "
Mugger," Alright, lady, now give me your purse!"
Phoebe, No.
Ross," (still in a high-pitched voice) What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. "
Phoebe," Lowell, is that you?"
Lowell, Phoebe? (He lifts his cap) Oh my god!
Phoebe, (simultaneously) Oh my god! 
Phoebe," (excited) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross."
Lowell," Ross, nice to meet you. (He stretches his hand out to him) "
Ross," Yeah, a real pleasure."
Phoebe," Ah, it's been so long, so long. (They hug again) I can't believe you're still doing this!"
Lowell," Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!"
Phoebe, Good for you! 
Lowell, So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
Phoebe, Ouh… (she nods)
Ross," (shocked) Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? "
Phoebe," Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up…"
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits on the couch as Joey enters]"
Monica," Hey, how did the audition go? "
Joey," Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. (He sits down) "
Monica, What happened?
Joey," Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less."
Monica, So far so good! (Joey nods)
Chandler," (entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!"
Monica," (standing up, walking towards him) What's wrong?"
Chandler, I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Monica, So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive
Chandler," Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)"
Joey, Wooooooooow (He takes the sneaker) It's like they're on fire!
Monica, What are they? (They sit down again)
Chandler, They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Joey, (determined) I give you $ 500 for them!
Chandler, What am I supposed to do with these?
Monica," Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time."
Chandler," Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look"
Monica," Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? "
Chandler," No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. "
Joey," Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? "
[Scene," Central Perk, Monica sits on the couch as Phoebe and Ross enter]"
All," Hey, hey!"
Ross," Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!"
Monica, You okay?!
Ross," (sitting down) Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! "
Monica, (bewildered) How do you know a mugger?
Phoebe, I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. 
Ross, You wanna know how she knew him? (He points at Phoebe) Because Phoebe used to mug people. 
Monica, (shocked) Seriously?
Phoebe," Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…"
Monica," (disapproving) Phoebe, that is awful!"
Phoebe," Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…"
Monica, You're mother killed herself!
Phoebe, She was a drug dealer!
Ross," Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because (menacingly) I was about to do some serious damage! "
Phoebe, (laughing) Okay…
Monica," Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross."
Phoebe, Why?
Monica," Well, Ross was mugged as a kid."
Phoebe, (worried) You were?
Ross," Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- "
Monica, (coughing) Wonderwoman!
Ross," Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone… (He looks at Monica) … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says"
Phoebe, (shocked) Oh my god…
Ross, I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book
Monica, Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Ross, A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Monica, That's it. 
Ross," Well, I-I better get to class (He stands up) Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?"
Phoebe," No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. "
Phoebe," Okay, I think we have a problem here. "
Monica, What?
Phoebe," Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. "
Monica, Yeah?
Phoebe," Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. "
Monica, So?
Phoebe," Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-"
Phoebe and Monica," ""Geology rocks!"" "
Monica, Oh my god!
Phoebe, I know… I mugged Ross! 
[Scene," Audition room, the producers and Lennart are waiting for Joey]"
Receptionist, You're late!
Joey," (entering) I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"
Receptionist," No, Lennart doesn't wait!"
Joey, But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Lennart, (spotting Joey) Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
Joey," Actually, I really need…"
Lennart," (interrupting) We must go now, quickly, please."
Joey, Yes… ahahaaa (He seems to be in pain)
Lennart," Ready? ""What the hell are you still doing here?"""
Joey," (walking on the spot) ""I think you know!"" "
Lennart," ""Oh, you sick bastard!"""
Joey," ""I am what you made me! You know what?"""
Lennart," ""What?"""
Joey," ""I could go right now."" "
Lennart," ""Then go, go!"""
Joey," (urgent) ""I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"""
Lennart, Cut! That was good. (He turns to the producers) That was very good. You did everything I asked for. 
Joey, (disbelieving) I did? 
Lennart," Yes. Plus… what you've got that… I don't know what you've got going… this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do"
Joey," Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. (He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room)"
Lennart, (watching Joey leave) Look at that
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Chander sits on the couch as Monica and Rachel enter]"
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler," Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…"
Rachel," Oh, anything yet?"
Chandler," Yes, how's this"
Joey, (entering) Hey!
All, Hey! 
Joey, Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?
Monica," No, that seems about right."
Joey," Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
Rachel," Joey, that was formula."
Joey, We gotta get more of that. (He leaves the apartment)
Chandler, (sitting on the couch) You know what… these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Rachel," Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. "
Chandler, Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel youger already! 
Chandler," (on the floor) Yah, I think I broke my hip."
[Scene," Central Perk, Phoebe is there drinking coffee and Ross is about to enter]"
Phoebe," (spotting Ross) Hey, you!"
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe," Hey, how was class?"
Ross," No one ever asked me that, what's wrong? "
Phoebe," Nothing, I really wanna know."
Ross," Oh… (He looks positively surprised) Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…"
Phoebe," (interrupting) Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…"
Ross, (disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Phoebe," You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl."
Ross," No, it wasn't."
Phoebe," Yes, it was. "
Ross," No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…"
Phoebe," (interrupting, pinching his year) ""Gimme your money, punk!"""
Ross," (shocked) Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me? "
Phoebe," (apologetic) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. (She smiles at him, but he doesn't understand) I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! "
Ross, It's not the best!
Phoebe," I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…"
Ross, (indignant) There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 
Phoebe, Really? Even more humiliating than…
Ross," (interrupting) Hey, let's not do this! "
[Scene," Chandler's new workplace, we are witnessing a presentation of a fellow intern]"
Intern," … and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!"
Boss, (ironic) That's interesting! Just one thought
Chandler, Okay… (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…
Intern, (snorting) Your age?
Chandler," A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads"
Boss," Chandler, that's great! "
Chandler," Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)"
Boss," You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's…. (enthusiastic) You did you come up with that?"
Chandler," (over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
Boss, That is great. Good work!
Boss, See all of you tomorrow. (He leaves)
Chandler, The cold weather hurts my hip!
[Scene," Central Perk, Ross sits in a chair as Phoebe enters]"
Phoebe," Hey, Ross! (He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? "
Ross," Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. (He raises his hands as if being mugged)"
Phoebe, I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. 
Ross," (faking enthusiasm) Oh my god, crap from the street? (She smiles excitedly, but Ross just turns back to his newspaper) "
Phoebe," Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (Ross looks at her in astonishment) Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"" (She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross)"
Ross, Oh my god. (He sighs) I never thought I'd see this again. (He browses trough the pages) It's all here. What made you save it all these years? 
Phoebe," I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. "
Ross," You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving! "
Phoebe," Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. "
Ross," Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. "
Phoebe," You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him "
Ross, You're welcome. 
[Scene," Audition room, Joey and Lennart are rehearsing]"
Joey," (hoping frantically on the spot, screaming) ""I need an answer!"""
Lennart," ""I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."""
Joey," ""You know!"""
Lennart," ""I don't know!"""
Joey," ""I need an answer now!"" "
Lennart," ""Alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is…"""
Joey, (screaming) Oh!
Lennart," ""She never loved me, she only loved you."""

Monica," Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask"
Chandler, You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal
Monica, Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Chandler, No! We're not borrowing money.
Monica, Why not?
Chandler, Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing

Joey," Oh, women can. You can't."
Rachel, Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?

Chandler, Hey! Ready to go?
Ross," Oh yeah, let me just finish this."
Joey," Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!"
Chandler, What are you doin'?
Ross," Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
Chandler," Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
Ross, It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Chandler, The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Ross," Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... "
Chandler, Bet she'd sleep with you now... 
Ross, No... I already e-mailed her.
Chandler, Let me see what you wrote about yourself
Ross," You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat."
Joey, Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
Ross, (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
Chandler," Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!"
Joey," (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
Ross," (he comes back) Alright, let's go!"
Joey, Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
Ross, I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Joey, (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
[Scene, Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Rachel, Hey! How was basketball?
Joey," Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
Rachel," Oh, no! Who did that?"
Joey, Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
Rachel," She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?"
Joey," (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!"
Rachel," Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!"
Joey," Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... "
Rachel," All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
Joey, Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
[Scene, Central Perk]
Phoebe, Hi.
Monica, Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Phoebe," Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!"
Chandler," Oh, I'm so sorry!"
Phoebe," Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this... "
Chandler, You're not gonna need my help?
Phoebe," Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
Chandler," Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"
Phoebe," Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
Monica," Ok, you got it!"
Phoebe," (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."
Monica, Really? If that's what you want... 
Phoebe, That was a test and you just failed.
Monica, Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Ross, (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
Chandler, I believe I read that somewhere!
Ross," That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!"
Chandler, I respectfully disagree.
Ross, I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Chandler, Who cares? Nobody reads those things
Ross, You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Chandler, I don't have a page.
Ross, Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
[Scene, Rachel's room. Rachel and Emma are sleeping; Joey sneaks in and approaches the crib]
Joey," Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)"
Rachel, (threatening Joey with a scrunchy)
Joey," It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
Rachel, What are you doing?
Joey," Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
Rachel," Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom."
Joey, (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is looking at the screen of his laptop, shaking his head.]"
Monica," Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?"
Chandler, Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Monica, But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
Chandler, Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Monica," (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge."
Chandler," Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something)."
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler," Oh, you'll see my friend."
Ross, (visibly upset) I'm dead?
Chandler, (faking sympathy) And so young.
Ross, Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Chandler," Well, how you died was funny."
Ross," Oh please, hit by a blimp?"
Chandler, It kills over one americans every year.
Ross," Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here."
Chandler, You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ross," You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic."
[Scene, Phoebe's apartment]
Phoebe," God, I wish Mike were here."
Monica, Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica," What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
Phoebe," I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
Monica," Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone."
Phoebe, Here.
Monica, And now your cell.
Phoebe," Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)"
Monica, This is your cellphone?
Phoebe, Yes.
Monica, This is your current cellphone?
Phoebe," Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
Monica," Phoebe, where's your purse?"
Monica," No, no! Give it to me!"
Phoebe, You can't have it.
Monica, Give it to me!
Phoebe, No (tucks it in her pants)
Monica, I'll go in there.
Phoebe, (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
Monica, Phoebe come here
Monica, Haha!
Phoebe, Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
[Scene, Joey and Rachel's. Enter Joey]
Joey," Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
Rachel," Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
Joey," No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!"
Rachel," Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."
Joey," No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
Rachel," Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... "
Joey, Make the transfer! (She does so)
Rachel, Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Joey," Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
Rachel," Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."
Joey, But he's the same.
Rachel," Yeah, I think she wants the old one back."
Joey, But he's the same.
Rachel," Joey, come on!"
Joey, He's the same!
Joey, (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
[Scene, Phoebe's apartment. Enter Monica]
Monica, Haha!
Phoebe," You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
Monica," So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
Phoebe, Those are my shoes.
Monica," Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
Phoebe," Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
Monica, Who's that? (goes to open door)
Phoebe, I ordered Chinese food.
Phoebe, What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Monica, (To Mike) What are you doing here?
Mike, Phoebe called me.
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe," I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him."
Monica, Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe, There is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
Monica, Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Mike," Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see... "
Monica, (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
Mike," Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!"
Monica," Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
Phoebe, Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Monica," Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical)."
Phoebe, Sit down.
Monica, Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
Mike, (to Phoebe) So how've you been?
Monica, I've been pretty good!
Mike, (to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.
Phoebe," Thanks, you look good too."
Monica, Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Phoebe, So how's the piano playing going?
Mike, Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Phoebe, I've missed you too.
Monica," You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!"
[Scene, Ross's Apartment
Chandler," Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
Ross," uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)"
Chandler, Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Ross," Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"
Chandler," No, come on, you know that's not true."
Ross, What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Chandler," Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
Ross, I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
Chandler," Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
Ross, You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Chandler," Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
Ross, Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
Chandler," Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
Ross, No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Chandler," Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
Ross," oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... "
[Scene, Joey's room
Rachel," I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?"
Joey, Original or crappy?
Rachel, Original.
Joey," No, sorry haven't seen him."
Rachel, Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Joey," It's Monica, ok?"
Rachel, That's not Monica!
Joey," Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.."
Rachel, (to herself) Oh God.
Joey, ... she's being unreasonable!
Rachel," (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!"
Joey, It does?
Rachel, Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Joey, Really? She... she loves me?
Rachel," Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room)."
Joey," Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him."
Rachel," Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!"
Joey, Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.
Rachel, Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Joey, How do you think I got him in the first place?
[Scene, Phoebe's apartment
Monica," Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss"
Mike," I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night."
Phoebe," I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?"
Mike," It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped."
Monica," (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!"
Phoebe, What?
Monica, Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Phoebe," Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)"
Strange man, (he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!
Mike," Oh, crap!"
Phoebe, Who is this?
Mike, My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Monica," Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
Manny," Well, you are not doing a very good job!"
Monica, Excuse me?
Manny, What's with the kissing?
Monica," Hey, at least I knew where my guy was."
Manny," Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!"
Monica, You didn't hear the speech!
Manny, I've heard the speech
Monica," Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!"
Manny, You're weak!
Monica, You're... weird!
Manny, Your pants are undone!
Monica, Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
Manny, (looking at the sofa) Where did they go?
Monica, Damn it!
Manny, Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
Monica, And I blame you too.

Ross," It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
Chandler, There you go! Someone came!
Ross," Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)"
Monica," Hi, glad you could come."
Chandler," (in a mournful voice) Please, come in."
Tom," Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class."
Chandler," Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
Tom," Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's... "
Chandler, At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
Ross, Who is he?
Chandler," Some guy, Tom Gordon."
Ross," I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)"
Monica," So, did you know Ross well?"
Tom," Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?"
Monica," (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me."
Tom, What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Chandler," (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"
Tom," (before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me."
Chandler, Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
Ross, (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
Monica, I look like a man??
Chandler," Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
Ross," It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"
Chandler," You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
Ross," Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
Chandler," Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
Ross, (sceptical) Yeah... 
Chandler," I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)"
Kori, Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Chandler, Kori? Kori Weston?
Kori, Yeah... 
Chandler, Wow! You look amazing!
Kori, And you are... 
Chandler," Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
Monica, You are married though.
Chandler," Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)"
Kori, I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Chandler, I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Kori, We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Chandler," I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
Kori, I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Ross," (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
Kori," You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)"
Ross, Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
[Scene, Ross' apartment]
Ross," (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?"

Director," Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!"
Joey," Oh, wish me luck!"
Rachel," Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?"

Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)"
Director, On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
(the scene starts.Joey enters and there's a girl wearing a wedding dress near a bed)Actress/Olivia, Drake! What are you doing in here?
Joey/Drake, Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
Actress/Olivia, Get out!
Joey/Drake, You don't love him!
Actress/Olivia, What do you know about love?
Joey/Drake, I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
Actress/Olivia, That kiss never happened.
Joey/Drake," Oh, what about this one."
(the actress slaps him)Rachel," (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!"
Actress/Olivia," No, I told you...get out!"
Joey/Drake, Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
Chase Lassiter," (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we..."
Rachel, SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Joey/Drake, Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
Actress/Olivia, I don't have a choice...
Joey/Drake," Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you."
Actress/Olivia, Don't say that...
Joey/Drake," Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)"
Director, CUT!

[Scene, Monica's restaurant]
1st Customer, Everything was delicious!
Monica, Thank you!
2nd Customer, It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Monica, Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
3rd Customer, Actually I do have one small complaint.
Monica, Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
3rd Customer, The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Monica, What musician?
[Scene, Outside the restaurant]
Phoebe," (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!"
Monica, What are you doing here!
Phoebe," Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!"
Monica, Great!
Phoebe," Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
Monica, Listen Phoebe...
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica," You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but..."
Phoebe, But what?
Monica, This is kind of a classy place.
Phoebe," (pause) Ok, say no more."

Chandler," Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
Receptionist," Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?"
Chandler, New York.
Ross, (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
Chandler," I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
Ross," Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody."
Receptionist," I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer."
Chandler," Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
Ross, (high pitched voice) Check again please!
Receptionist," I'm sorry, it's not here."
Ross, Not there.
Chandler," Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
Receptionist, I don't know what to say.
Ross, (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
Chandler, Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Receptionist," Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars."
Chandler, That's insane!
Ross," Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
Chandler, Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
Receptionist, Great.
Chandler," (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!"
Ross," Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!"
Chandler," Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
Ross," C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
Chandler," Dude, you're shaking!"
Ross," I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
[Scene, Joey's apartment]
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel," Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!"
Joey," Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
Rachel," God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
Joey," Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?"
Rachel," Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress."
Joey," Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
Rachel," Oh screw her, that part is mine!"
Joey," Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
Rachel," Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here."
Joey/Drake, I can't believe you married him.
Rachel/actress, But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Joey/Drake, So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
Rachel/actress, It's over! You have to accept that.
Joey/Drake," How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now."
Rachel, (pause) Kiss me.
Joey, What?
Rachel, Kiss me.
Joey," Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!"
Rachel," No, I'm saying..."
Joey," but, but.."
Rachel, just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
[Scene, Rachel's bedroom]

[Scene, Hotel's room]
Ross," (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. "
(Chandler enters the room)Ross, What did you get?
Chandler, USA Today
Ross," Nice, put it with the others."
Chandler, And I also got... two more apples.
Ross," We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  "
Chandler, I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ross," Oh, that's not cool."
Chandlers," Dude, none of this is cool."
Ross," No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example"
Chandler," I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that."
Ross," Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
Chandler," Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?"
Ross," No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
Chandler," Yes, but the batteries..."
(Ross claps his hands)Chandler," Thank you, thank you very much!"
Ross, Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Chandler, No!
Ross, At least tell me where you hid it.
[Scene, Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]
Rachel, Can I ask you a question?
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Monica," Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."
Rachel," Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey."
Monica," Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
Rachel," Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense."
Monica, What do you think brought than on?
Rachel," I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
Monica, A love scene? With who?
Rachel, Olivia.
Monica," Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important."
Rachel, So do you think that my dream means anything?
Monica," I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
Rachel, Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Monica," Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. "
Rachel, You took the same class twice.
Monica, It was hard!
(Phoebe comes in)Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel and Monica, Hi.
Phoebe," Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
Monica," Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
Phoebe," Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
Monica," Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
Phoebe," Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot)."
(silence)Rachel," Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
Phoebe, My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Rachel," Ok, we're still on that."
Monica, I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Phoebe, Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Monica, Tiny portions?
Phoebe," Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it""!"
Monica," Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
Phoebe, Well...it's not about quality.
Monica," Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."
Phoebe," Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
Monica," Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
Phoebe," Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
Monica," You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
Phoebe," What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
[Scene, Hotel's reception]
Receptionist," Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay."
Chandler," Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
(the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler," Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax."
Ross," Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game."
"(they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross", Oh my god.
Chandler, What?
Ross, There's something new in the bowl.
Chandler," Look, we have enough, just walk away."
Ross," No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
Chandler, There's a forest right outside.
Ross, It's not the same.
Chandler," Ok, go quick!"
"(Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross", (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
"(he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross"," Oh, my maple candy!"
[Scene, In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]
Phoebe, (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
(Monica comes out)Monica," Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
Phoebe," You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
Monica," Ok, you have to stop playing now."
Phoebe, Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Monica," Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
Phoebe, (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Monica," (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question"
Phoebe," Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!"
Monica," Alright, let me ask you this question"
Phoebe," Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
Monica, Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
Phoebe," Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands)."
Monica, Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question
Phoebe, Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
Monica, I'm sorry...
Phoebe, I'm sorry too... (they hug)
Monica, ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? 
Phoebe, Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... 
(Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe," (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?"
[Scene," Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]"
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel," Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
Joey, (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Rachel, (looks puzzled) How...how...?
Joey," I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? "
Rachel, uh-huh
Joey," And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! "
Rachel, (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
Joey, What?
Rachel, What...how is it going with Drake?
Joey, Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Rachel, What...that scene I saw was so good!
Joey," Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
Rachel," Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
Joey," A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
Rachel, So?
Joey, So...I've never played that!
Rachel," Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
Joey, Uh...well...just once...with you...
Rachel, Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Joey, (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
Rachel," (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
Joey," (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
Rachel," (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
Joey," Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
(Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey, (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
 [Scene," Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area]"
Chandler, I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
Monica, (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
(Then Ross enters)Ross," (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"

Joey," (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
Chandler," (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV."
Joey," Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
Chandler, I could fall asleep at a play.
Phoebe, What is it?
Joey," It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me"
Monica, It sounds interesting!
Ross," Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)"
Phoebe," I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
Joey," You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!"
Ross, What? How come that you don't have to go!
Joey," I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."
Chandler," (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?"
Rachel," (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry."
Joey," (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go."
Rachel," Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?"
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Monica," No, I don't think it ever works. Why?"
Rachel, No reason.
Monica," No, no, Rachel?"
Rachel, Yeah
Monica, Who do you wanna fool around with?
Rachel," (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!"
"(Monica points at Joey, Rachel turns and sees him)Rachel", (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
Monica, (whispering) You can't!
Rachel," (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with ""because"") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said."
Monica, In the hall.
[Scene, In the hall]
Monica, You wanna fool around with Joey?
Rachel," Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
Monica, Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Rachel," Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
Monica," Who, who are they?"
Rachel, I know them from work.
Monica, Both of them?
Rachel," No, one of them..."
Monica, Which one?
Rachel," I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
Monica," Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
Rachel," All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)"
Monica, What the hell are you cooking!
Opening credits[Scene," Central Perk, Ross enters]"
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross," Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today."
Chandler," Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
Ross," (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus."
Monica, What's so bad about that?
Ross, It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Monica, (fingering her elbow)
Ross," (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede."
(a woman walks in)Charlie," (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?"
Gunther, No.
Ross," Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."
Charlie," Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer."
Ross," Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
Charlie, It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Ross," Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
Monica, (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
Chandler," (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
Charlie," And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis."
Ross," Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute."
Monica, (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Ross," (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
Charlie," Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?"
Ross, I don't think so.
Charlie," I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?"
Ross," Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?"
Charlie, You don't think we should wait for him?
Ross," You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
Professor Spafford, Professor Geller?
Ross," Oh, damn it!"

Joey, (entering the room) Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, What's happenin'?

Rachel, (angry) You are having a party tonight??
Joey, Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Rachel, And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Joey, I do it every year.
Rachel, You do that every year??
Joey, I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Rachel," Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??"
Joey, Yeah...
Rachel, And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Joey, Yeah...
Rachel," OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
Joey, (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Rachel," Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
Joey," You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
Rachel," Well, then so you just invite me...!"
Joey," (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"
Rachel," Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please..."

[Scene," Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant]"
Professor Spafford," (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish."
Ross," (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
Professor Spafford, And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Ross," (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!"
Professor Spafford," I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts..."
Ross, So basically all nuts?
Professor Spafford, Interestingly... no.
Charlie," Kinda playing fast and loose with the word ""interesting""."
Professor Spafford, If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)
Charlie, Oh my God!!
Ross, I've lost the will to live.
Charlie, Let's ditch him!
Ross, What?
Charlie," Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!"
Ross," Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
Charlie," Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)"

Phoebe, Hi!
Ross," Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department."
Phoebe," Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"
Charlie," Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas..."
Phoebe," Ah, ah."
Charlie," (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)"
Ross, (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Phoebe," Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!"
Monica," (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?"
Ross," Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
Monica, And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!

Ross, Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Rachel," I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!"
Charlie," Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry."
Rachel," ... Ok, who is this?"
Ross," I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."

Rachel," What? Yes, I am!"
Monica," Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??"
Rachel," When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)"
Monica, You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Rachel," Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
Monica," Ok, what is this?"
Rachel, Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Monica, (aloud) WHAT?
Ross, (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
Monica, Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Rachel, And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Charlie, I thought you came to say you were sick.
Rachel, Ok professor or detective?
Phoebe, Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Rachel," Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!"
Phoebe, And that horrible museum tour!
Ross," No, I arranged that..."
"(Joey enters, wearing a bathrobe)Joey"," (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun."
Phoebe, We know about your party Joey.
Joey, What party?
Monica, The game's over! Take off your robe!
Joey, (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
Everyone, No!! Cover it up!!
Joey, (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
[Scene, The Roof]
Joey," (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming."
Monica, Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Kyle Lowder, (to Monica) Hi. (walks on)
Monica, (Yells after him) I love you!
Joey," Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
Monica, Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica," (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself."
Phoebe," Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)"
Monica, (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
[Scene," The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]"
Chandler, Where the hell is everybody?
(The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)Bitter lady, (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One
[Scene," The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]"
Monica," (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too"
Rachel," Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number."
Monica, Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Matthew Ashford, It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Rachel, Nice to meet you.
Matthew Ashford, Call me.
Rachel, Ok
(Matthew leaves)Monica, (yelling after him) We will!!
Monica, (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
Rachel, Yeah!
Monica, I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Rachel," Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
Monica, Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
(cut to Ross and Charlie)Ross," (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?"
Charlie," Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone."
Ross," Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"
Charlie," Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with."
Ross, You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Charlie, Yeah...
Ross, ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Charlie," Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man."
Ross," Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
Charlie," Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues..."
Ross," (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
Charlie," Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him."
Ross, Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie, A guy who won two.
Ross, (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Charlie, Yeah... for three years.
Ross, Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie, (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Ross," Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
Charlie," No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant."
Ross, Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
Phoebe, Hey Ross!
Rache, How is it going with Charlie?
Ross, (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Phoebe," Oh, What's the matter?"
Ross," She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
Rachel, I always loved that!!
Ross," Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!"
Phoebe, Worse?
Ross," Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) ""Can we walk""? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?"
Phoebe, (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
Ross, What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
Rachel, Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
[Scene, Chandler in the theater]
Bitter lady," Well, I bet you are all thinkin' ""Now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?"
Chandler," (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!"
Bitter lady," (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7"
Chandler, I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
[Scene," The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]"
Joey," Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)"
Ross, Nice to meet you.
Dirk, Hey! So what show are you on?
Ross," Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
(Dirk is confused)Joey, It's a science.
Dirk," Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on ""Days"". And my character has just won the Nobel prize."
(Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)Joey," Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
Ross," Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
Dirk," Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs."
Ross, I'd lead with that.
"(Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)Monica"," That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so)."
Joey, Monica!
Monica," Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
"(Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)Joey", (To Rachel) What have you got there?
Ross, Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Joey," Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?"
Rachel, (drunken voice) I think I am.
Joey," (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different."
(Rachel is puzzled)Joey," (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass..."
Rachel," (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
Joey," Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
Rachel," Joey, you're so sweet."
Joey," That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
Rachel, Who (looks around)?
(Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey, Me.
Rachel, (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
Joey," Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
Rachel," Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)"
Joey, Gotcha.
Rachel," Oh, Very funny... Joey."
(Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler," (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?"
Monica," Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
Chandler, Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Monica, You really liked it?
Chandler," Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16"
Monica, Oh really!
Chandler," Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
Monica, No!
Chandler, Did somebody sign your bra?
Monica, So I got it when I was 13...
[Scene," At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]"
Phoebe," Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
Ross," It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
Phoebe," Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, "
Ross," Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited."
Phoebe," You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
Ross, And sexy.
Phoebe, Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Ross," Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
Phoebe," Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
Ross, Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
(Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel, (to Monica) Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind
Monica," No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
Rachel," Please, what about you and Chandler?"
Monica, That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Rachel, Well hello (points to herself)!
Monica, What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Rachel," I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
Monica, Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Rachel, (pause) I'm gonna do it.
Monica, And I can't stop you.
Rachel, No.
(Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)Ross," (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?"
"(Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)Ross", I'm smarter than him!
Closing credits[Scene," The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]"
Phoebe," Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
Chandler," Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
Monica," Oh, you're so wonderful."

[Scene," Central Perk. Charlie, Joey and Rachel are on the couches]"
Charlie, (while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!
Rachel," (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!"
Charlie," I'm sorry, what?"
Rachel," Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma."
Charlie, From... Cosmo??
Rachel," Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
Charlie," (to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!"
Joey," So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
Rachel," (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
Joey, Oh hey Rach!
Rachel, Yeah...
Joey, Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Rachel," Oh, well..."
Charlie, I'm sure you have better things to do.
Joey," Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
Charlie," If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help."
Rachel," Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!"
Joey," (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
Phoebe," (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?"
Joey," What's the matter, Pheebs?"
Phoebe," Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!"
Rachel," Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
Phoebe, Exactly!
Rachel, And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Phoebe," (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!"
Rachel," Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
Phoebe," Ok, that'll be great!"
Joey," Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
Rachel, That's not what we're gonna do!
Joey," Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
Opening credits[Scene, Doctor Connelly's office]
Chandler, (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Monica," Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
Chandler," Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
Doctor Connelly, (entering) Hi there.
Chandler, Hi.
Monica, Hi.
Doctor Connelly, I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Monica, Ok.
Doctor Connelly," Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis."
Chandler," Oh, DAMN IT!"
Monica," Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
Doctor Connelly," Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor."
Monica, (long pause) Ok.
Doctor Connelly," And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt."
Chandler," Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
[Scene, Central Perk. Joey and Charlie on the couch. Rachel enters]
Rachel," Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
Charlie," Oh, yeah! Let's do it!"
Joey," (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)"
Rachel, Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Ross," (entering) Hey, you guys!"
Rachel, Hi.
Ross, Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Charlie, Umh... Kurts Baley?
Ross," Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?"
Joey," Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
Charlie, So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
Ross," Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today."
Charlie, He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
Ross," Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him."
Rachel," Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
Ross," Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve)."
Chandler, (entering) Hey guys!
Ross," Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
Chandler," I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
Ross, It's in Barbados.
Chandler, But you come first!
Rachel, I'm there!
Charlie," We'll see you, guys! (she goes)"
Joey, Bye.
Rachel," Bye, see ya. (she goes)"
Chandler, (sitting down on the couch) Ok.
Joey," All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?"
Chandler, Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Ross, So-so what did the doctor say?
Chandler," Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
Joey, So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey," So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
Chandler," Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
Joey," Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"
Chandler, (stopping Joey) ah-ha!
Ross, How do you feel about all this?
Chandler, I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Joey," Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!"
Ross, (puzzled) What?
Ross, (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
[Scene," Professor Sherman's office, Ross is relating to Professor Sherman]"
Ross, The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Professor Sherman, Mmm-mm.
Ross," (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
Ross," Oh, that's not what you want..."
[Scene," Shop, Rachel, Charlie and Phoebe walk in]"
Shop assistant, (to a girl) Incentive For Men?
Phoebe," Oh, I'll take some of that."
Rachel," Pheebs, that's for men!"
Phoebe," No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah."
Phoebe," Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!"
Charlie," (to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?"
Rachel," On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here."
Charlie," See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a ""thank you"", I would really love to take you out."
Rachel, Really?
Charlie," Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?"
Rachel," Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them."
Charlie, You've seen all the movies...
Rachel," Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!"
Phoebe," (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
Rachel, Sure!
Phoebe, Ok!
Charlie," Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!"
Rachel, You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Phoebe," So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?"
Rachel," She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
Phoebe, Why?
Rachel," I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
Phoebe, Who else?
Rachel," Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
Phoebe, You like Joey?
Rachel," Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him."
Phoebe, (whispering) Oh my God!
Rachel," It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"
Phoebe," Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
Rachel," (annoyed) Oh, I get it!"
Phoebe," Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
Rachel," I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal."
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, So can we keep this between us?
Phoebe, Sure!
Rachel," Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
[Scene," Monica's apartment, Chandler walks in with a friend of his while Monica is putting fruit in a bowl.]"
Monica, Hi honey!
Chandler," Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
Monica," Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
Zack, (shaking Monica's hand) You too.
Chandler," You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
Monica, I got it.
Zack, Thanks.
Chandler," (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
Monica," Yeah, I guess."
Chandler," So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
Monica, (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
Chandler," Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
Monica," Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!"
Chandler," No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
Monica, Chandler!
Chandler," I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
Monica, I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Chandler, Ok!
Monica, Uh!
Chandler, (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
Zack, Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
Monica," Tell me about yourself, Zack!"
[Scene," Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are talking in front of the dressing room]"
Rachel," Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!"
Phoebe," Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
Rachel," Ok, great!"
Rachel," Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
Phoebe, (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
Rachel," (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!"
Phoebe, (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Rachel, (comes out again) What!?
Phoebe," (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
Rachel," Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!"
Phoebe, Ooh! We have a problem.
Rachel, Oh! What are we gonna do?
Stranger, Just be honest with her.
Rachel, Oh my God!
Stranger, And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Rachel, (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
[Scene, Joey's apartment. Joey is sitting on his bed and the phone rings]
Joey, Hello?
Ross," Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
Joey, No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Ross, I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Joey, Oh! How's it going?
Ross," It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!"
Joey, What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Ross, Barbados.
Joey," Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
Ross, What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Joey," Well, just wake him up!"
Ross," I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!"
Joey," Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
[Scene," Chandler and Monica's apartement. Chandler and the guest are in the living room, Monica in the kitchen]"
Monica, Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Zack, Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!
Chandler," So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
Monica," Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
Chandler, You don't like him.
Monica, I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Chandler, Alright! Just follow my lead!
Zack, You guys have such a great place here.
Chandler," Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
Zack, Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for 
Chandler, (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Zack," (looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet."
Monica," Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you"
Zack," (after a pause, very confused) No..."
Monica," Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?"
Zack," You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?"
Monica, We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
Zack, Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Chandler," You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an ""ok"" sign)"
Zack," Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?"
Monica & Chandler, Sure! Alright...
Zack, Ravioli's delicious!
Chandler, I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Zack, No I didn't.
Monica, Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
Chandler, (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
[Scene, In the store. Rachel and Phoebe returning from the changing rooms]
Rachel, Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Phoebe, Good plan.
Rachel, Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Phoebe," Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! (at which she walks away)"
Rachel," (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"
Charlie, Oh! trying on clothes.
Rachel," (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"
Charlie, (smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Rachel," Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain."
Charlie, No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Rachel, (after a pause) Yeah.
Charlie," It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"
Rachel," Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"
Charlie, Wow!
Rachel, Yeah...
Charlie," You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person."
Rachel, (Looks ashamed) I try...
[Scene," Prof. Sherman's office. Sherman is still asleep on his chair, blocking the door.]"
Ross, (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
Prof. Sherman, (confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)
[Scene," Central Perk. Joey is sitting on the sofa, eating a cookie.]"
Joey, (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Phoebe, Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Joey, Then don't go!
Phoebe," Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
Joey," Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
Phoebe," You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
[Scene, Outside Central Perk.]
Phoebe, David?
David, Phoebe! Hi!
Phoebe, Oh my God! (they hug)
David," Wow, you look unbelievable."
Phoebe, Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
David," Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently."
Phoebe, What happened?
David," Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?"
Phoebe, Yeah?
David," Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done."
Phoebe," Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"
David," Good, good, life is good..."
Phoebe, Good!
David," Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone."
Phoebe," (disappointed) Oh, good for you."
David," She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said ""Boy, I want that""."
Phoebe, Mike and I broke up.
David," You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up."
Phoebe, Really?
David," Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face."
Phoebe," I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"
David," Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?"
Phoebe, Well... (pause) no.
David, Do you wanna get a drink?
Phoebe, I'd love to.
David, Great.
Phoebe, Ok. (they walk away together)
David, Do you smell beets?
Phoebe," Oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
Charlie," Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?"
Rachel," No, that's David."
Charlie, There's a third guy?
Rachel, (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
Zack," I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?"
Chandler, You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Zack," No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired."
Chandler," Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
Zack, No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
Chandler, Ok.
Chandler, I think we've found our sperm!
Monica, Does seem pretty perfect.
Chandler," Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?"
Monica, (pause) No.
Chandler," Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
Monica," No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
Chandler," Yeah, he's better!"
Monica," No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
Chandler, Really? Are you sure?
Monica," Yeah, I'm sure."
Chandler," (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
Monica, That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
Chandler, So you know this leaves us with...
Monica, Adoption.
Chandler, How do you feel about that?
Monica, I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Chandler, Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Monica," So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
Chandler, (smiling) Yeah.
Monica," (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!"
Chandler, We are gonna be great parents.
Monica," And it could be soon. I mean, think about it"
Chandler," Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
Closing credits[Scene, Zack's office]
Chandler," Hey, Zack!"
Zack, (hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler.
Chandler," Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
Zack, No you didn't.
Chandler, Really?
Zack, No you did.
Chandler," My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
Jeanette, (to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something).
Zack," Oh, thank you."
Chandler," You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"

Joey, (entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Ross," Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?"
Joey, Mmh-mmh.
Ross, (to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
Joey, Barbados!
Ross," Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
Rachel, Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Chandler," Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
Phoebe, I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Ross," Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
Phoebe," No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
Ross," Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
Joey," All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
Ross," It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
Opening credits[Scene, Paradise Hotel lounge in Barbados]
Charlie, Wow! This place is beautiful!
Ross, (very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
Joey," I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)"
Woman," Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!"
Joey," (to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
Woman," Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!"
Joey, That... never happens...
Woman," I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech."
Ross," Wow! This is very flattering, uh..."
Woman, I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)
Ross," Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear..."" (he takes the notepad)"
Woman, Sarah.
Ross," ""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller""."
Sarah, Thank you so much!
Ross," Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
Sarah, (to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?
Joey," No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives""."
Ross," Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the."
Joey," (thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
Sarah," I'm sorry, I don't own a TV."
Joey, You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
[Scene, Central Perk]
Monica," David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
David," Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
Monica, (to Chandler) See?
Chandler," Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
Monica," Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
Phoebe," Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
Phoebe, Mike?? Who's Mike?
David, Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
Phoebe," That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!"
David, It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Phoebe," Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!"
Chandler, (upset) She does?
Monica, (pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
Monica, At least you took me down with you!
Phoebe," I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?"
Monica," I guess, in time."
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica," I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone."
Phoebe," You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!"
[Scene, Inside Central Perk]
David," (to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?"
Chandler, I wouldn't read too much into it.
David," Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?"
Chandler," David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
David," Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe..."
Chandler," Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
David," I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?"
Chandler," Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
David, That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Chandler, What?
David," Well, I was probably going to do it at some point."
Chandler, I didn't mean now...
David," Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely."
Chandler," Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
David, (after a while) How do you think I should propose?
Chandler," David, I'm pretending to read here!!"
[Scene, Joey in his hotel in room in Barbados]
Joey, Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Joey," Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
Charlie, (laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Joey, You really should have been more clear about that!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Joey, Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Ross," Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!"
Charlie, Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Ross, Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Joey, You could say
Ross, (to Charlie) Ready to go?
Charlie, Yeah!
Joey, Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Charlie, Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Ross, Yeah.
Charlie, But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Joey, (smiling) Will you wear a thong?
Charlie, I will if you will.
Joey, Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Ross," (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them)."
Charlie, So you'll be ok?
Joey," Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
Ross," Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?"
Joey," No, why?"
Joey, Oh man!
Charlie," There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! (Ross agrees)"
Joey," I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)"
[Scene," Back in New York, Monica and Chandler in Central Perk on the couch]"
Monica, Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler," (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) ""I do""."
Monica," Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
Chandler, David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica, What? (looks very shocked) Why?
Chandler," Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
Monica," Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
Chandler," I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?"
Monica," They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again."
Chandler," Man, that's some bad advice!"
[Scene," Barbados, hotel lounge. David, Phoebe and Rachel have just arrived.]"
Joey, Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Rachel, Hey! Hey what's going on?
Joey," Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!"
Rachel," Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
Monica," Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!"
Chandler, That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Joey," Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)"
Monica," (to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!"
Phoebe," (shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!"
Monica, (shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
Rachel," Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy."
Phoebe, Not Joey.
Rachel," Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler."
Monica," Yeah, right!"
David," So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)"
Chandler," Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!"
David," Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor."
Chandler, (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
Chandler," Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)"
Monica, Ok!
Chandler, David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Monica, See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Chandler, That would be advice!!
Monica, Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Monica, (looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
Phoebe," Are you leaving ""The Supremes""? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)"
MOnica," Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight."
Phoebe, Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Monica, What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Phoebe," Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it"
Monica, Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Phoebe," Sure! Look, ok, bottom line"
[Scene, Ross's hotel room. Ross and is reading his keynote speech to Charlie from his laptop]
Ross," By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century."
Charlie, It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Ross," Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler)."
Joey, Hey guys!
Ross, The chocolates aren't here yet.
Joey, Damnit!
Charlie, Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Chandler," Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"
Ross," If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)"
Chandler, (offended) What? (pause) May I?
Rachel," (looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
Charlie, Actually the wet season is June to December.
Rachel, It's not the time Charlie.
Chandler," (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!"
Joey," Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?"
Chandler," Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
Ross, Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
Chandler, It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Ross," What, oh my God. What did you do?"
Chandler, Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ross," Why, why would you open it?"
Chandler," Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!"
Ross, What did it say?
Chandler, Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Ross," What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!"
Chandler," It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?"
Ross, NO! I don't!!
Chandler," Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
[Time lapse, Ross looks likes he's been trying to fix his computer but just closes it as if giving up]
Joey, It's really gone?
Ross, Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Chandler, I just feel awful.
Ross," Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
Chandler," Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)"
Ross, Get out! (Chandler runs out)
Rachel," You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
Ross," Well, what do you do?"
Rachel," Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."
Ross, I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Joey, I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Ross," I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"
Charlie," Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!"
Ross, Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Charlie," Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey)."
Joey," Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."
Rachel, Ugh.
Ross," Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic."
Joey," Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave)."
[Scene, Mike's apartment. His phone rings and he picks up]
Mike, Hello?
Monica," Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
Mike, Who is this?
Monica," This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!"
Mike, (sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?
Monica," I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)"
Mike," Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."
Monica," You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!"
Monica," (sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!"
Chandler," (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"
Monica," Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
Chandler," Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!"
Monica," No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"
Chandler, And there's not chance that will work?
Monica," No, I called him. It's not gonna happen."
Chandler, (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica," Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
Chandler, This vacation sucks!!
[Scene," The hall, full of paleontologists. Rachel and Joey are walking around]"
Joey," I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
Rachel," Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
Joey," Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
Joey, (stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Waiter," I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)"
Joey," Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
Rachel, We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Joey," (walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba..."
Rachel, (picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?
Joey, Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
Rachel, And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Joey," In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)"
Rachel, Thank you. (they walk away)
[Scene," Ross's room. Charlie is sitting on the bed, while Ross is walking up and down nervously]"
Charlie," And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century."
Ross," Yeah, that's it?"
Charlie, Yeah.
Ross," Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)"
Charlie, Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Ross," Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace."
Charlie, Thank you.
Ross," Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)"
Charlie," Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you."
Ross," Oh my God, I love you."
Charlie," Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?"
Ross," That's Ben, my son from my first marriage."
Charlie, Your first marriage?
Ross, Yeah.
Charlie, You're married more than once?
Ross, No. (they clink glasses and drink)
Charlie," So, why did you break up?"
Ross," (embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay."
Charlie," Oh my God, this is so cool!"
Ross," Ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
Charlie," No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!"
Ross, Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
Charlie, Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Ross, My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Charlie, Right and then everybody finds out and they're like
Ross," I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note"
Charlie, I know!
Ross," And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
Charlie, I didn't do that.
Ross, (embarassed) Me neither.
[Scene," the Pharmacist convention. Joey and Rachel are walking out of it, drinking cocktails]"
Joey," Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun."
Rachel," I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
Joey," Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
Rachel," Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
Joey," But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?"
Rachel," (takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No."
Joey," There it is, you're blushing!"
Rachel," No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain."
Joey, You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
Rachel, No.
Joey, Tell me who it is.
Rachel, Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
Joey," Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?"
Rachel," Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
Joey," What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?"
Rachel," Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
Joey," (eagerly) Yeah, who is that?"
Rachel, Do ya?
Joey, Yeah.
Ross and Charlie, Hey!
Charlie," (to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner."
Joey," Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
Ross," Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much."
Charlie, I had a great time.
Joey," Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who..."
Rachel, Later! La...
Charlie," So, shall we?"
Joey, Yeah. (they leave)
Rachel," Ok. See you, bye."
Charlie, Bye.
Ross, Good night.
Joey, Night.
Ross and Rachel," Ok, good night!"
[Scene, The restaurant. Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table]
Monica, I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Chandler," You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
David," Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say."
Monica," Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."
Chandler," I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!"
David," Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!"
Phoebe," Sure, ok, yeah."
David," But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end..."
Phoebe," Oh my God, Mike!"
David," It's David, actually!"
Phoebe," No, Mike's here."
David, (turns around) Hi Mike!
Mike," Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!"
Monica, IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Mike, Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe," What are you, what are you doing here?"
Mike, I have a question I need to ask you.
David, I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Mike," Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."
David," (annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?"
Mike," Actually yeah, that'll be great."
David," That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)"
Mike," Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you."
David, Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
Mike," Sorry David, but she really has to know this."
David," Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops."
Monica," You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring..."
David, I have a ring.
Chandler," I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
David," Phoebe, will you marry me?"
Phoebe, (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
David, Uhm... Ha ha!
Phoebe," I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
Mike, We can have any future you want.
David," Ok, I'm gonna take off."
Phoebe," David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
David," Just so I know, if I had asked first..."
Phoebe," Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
David," Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)"
Mike, Is it ok if I hug you now?
Phoebe, Yes! (they hug)
Monica, (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's room. Monica and Chandler are in bed.]
Chandler," Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."
Monica, I know (she snuggles to him)
Rachel, (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Chandler, I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Monica, The sun is out!
Chandler, Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Monica," Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
Chandler, Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Rachel, Nooo!
Monica, Damn it!
Ross," (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
[Scene, Conference room. Ross is making his keynote speech]
Ross, Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Rachel," Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!"
Ross," Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered"
Chandler, (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
Ross," And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."
Chandler, (to the one sitting next to him) Really?
Ross," But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus..."
Charlie, What?
Joey," He said ""erectus""!"
Charlie," You're... you're kidding, right?"
Joey," No, he really said it."
Ross, ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Joey, Erectus?
Rachel, Homo.
[Scene, the hotel conference room]
Ross, (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
Ross," Oh, thanks guys!"
Man with a bow tie, (shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!
Ross, Oh!
Man with a bow tie," Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully)."
Ross," (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)"
Rachel," All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?"
Monica, Yeah!
Rachel," (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!"
Ross," Oh, thank you so much!"
Joey," Yeah, and so funny!"
Rachel, Oh!
Ross," (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
Mike," (popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!"
Mike, Oh... I'm back!
Ross," (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?"
Phoebe & Mike, Yeah! (they leave)
Ross, Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
Charlie, You were incredible!
Ross, Yeah?
Charlie, You blew them away!
Ross," Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?"
Charlie, (smiling broadly) I was not!
Ross," No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
Charlie, Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your groupie!
Ross, (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Ross," (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!"
[Scene," the hotel lobby. Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk in from the outside.]"
Monica," (her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"
Phoebe," Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!"
Monica," So, what are we gonna do today?"
Mike, They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Monica," (pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
Chandler, I don't think so!
Monica, (disappointed) Why not?
Chandler," Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
Monica, I'm not always that bad!
Chandler," Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?"
Monica, (hesitatingly) I punched you...?
Chandler, And...?
Monica, ... Phoebe...?
Phoebe, ... and...?
Monica, I clunked your heads together!
[Scene, Joey and Charlie's room]
Charlie, (walking in) Hey! There you are!
Joey," Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)"
Charlie," I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon."
Joey," (disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
Charlie, You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and (pauses) especially last night...
Joey," (interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)"
Charlie," Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!"
Joey," (bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!"
Charlie, Yeah...
Charlie, ... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Joey," Yeah! A little bit, yeah..."
Charlie, (sitting down on the bed) I think we need to talk...!
Joey," Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?"
[Scene," the hotel game room. There is a ping pong table in the middle of the room. Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk in]"
Monica," C'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
Phoebe," All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!"
Monica, But then how do we know who wins?
Phoebe, Nobody wins!
Monica," So, we're just four losers... SUPER!"
Chandler, I'm not playing with you.
Phoebe," Yeah, I'm out."
Mike, I'll play ya!
Monica, (smiling) OK!
Phoebe," Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
Chandler, She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!
Mike, (disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
Monica, Sure! Got to!
Monica, Aww!
Mike," Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!"
Chandler," (nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!"
Mike, You're ready to play?
Monica," Hell, yeah!"
Chandler, (to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?
Phoebe, No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Mike, Wanna make it more interesting?
Monica, How much were you thinking?
Mike, Ten bucks a game?
Monica, Make it fifty!
Mike, I'll make it a hundred!
Monica, (nearly shouting) One thousand...
Chandler, (interrupting her) OK!
Mike," To see who goes first, you got a quarter?"
Monica, (going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?
Chandler," Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
Phoebe," (picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it."
Monica," Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!"
Phoebe, Tails!
Monica," (angry) Ow, what are the chances!"
Monica, Ha! My point!
Mike," Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point."
Phoebe, (smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!
[Scene, Rachel's hotel room. She is watching the Weather Channel on TV.]
Alexandra Steele," (meteorologist) (pointing to the East Coast)... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!"
Rachel, Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off)
Rachel," It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!"
Joey, (downhearted) Hey...
Rachel," (worried) What, is everything ok?"
Joey, Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Rachel," Nooooo, why?"
Joey," Oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
Rachel," (laughing) Oh, that's crazy!"
Joey," No, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
Rachel," ... yeah, it's true."
Joey," I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!"
Rachel," (pretending to be offended) What, hey!"
Joey," (laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!"
Joey," I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?"
Rachel," W-What are you, what are you talking about?"
Joey," Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)"
Rachel, Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Joey," (sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
Rachel," Yeah, I'm not talking about her..."
Joey, But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
Rachel, You know? Forget it!
Joey," (stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?"
Rachel," No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!"
Joey," Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!"
Rachel," Yeah, sure!"
[Scene," Rachel's hotel room. Joey is standing at the door, facing Rachel]"
Joey, You like me? (shuts the door)
Rachel," (nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
Joey, (shocked) That's a huge thing!
Rachel," Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing"
Joey, What... for how long?
Rachel, Only like a month!
Joey, (outraged) A MONTH??
Rachel," What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught) Ok, dial it up a little!"
Joey, (stands up) I just have one question!
Rachel, Shoot!
Joey, (desperate) What the hell are you doin'???
Rachel," I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?..."
Joey," Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!"
Rachel, (puzzled) Who...?
Joey," CURIOUS GEORGE (see link)! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
Rachel," Oh yes, of course, I remember him!"
Joey," Yeah, he had a paper route."
Rachel," Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!"
Joey," No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
Rachel, But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Joey," (charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"
Rachel," But why, why not?"
Joey," Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!"
Rachel, But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Joey," I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!"
Rachel," (regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!"
Joey," NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said"
Rachel, It's not a big deal!
Joey, NO BIG DEAL!
Rachel, It's so not a big deal!
Joey, Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Rachel, Ok!
Rachel," Ok, I..."
Rachel, AAAHHHH!

Mike, Do you?
Monica," Ah, yeah!"
Mike, Do you?
Monica," Ah, yeaaah!"
Mike, DO YOU?
Monica, AH YEAAAAH!
Chandler, (to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?
Phoebe," (looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"
Chandler, I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Phoebe," C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"
Monica," Oh, damn it!"
Phoebe, (pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!
Mike," (boasting) Game, point!"
Monica," (threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
Mike," You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that."
Monica," NO, NO, NOOO!"
Mike, And that's how it's done! (Phoebe kisses him)
Chandler," Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."
Monica, Best out of three?
Mike, That's what I'm thinking.
Chandler, Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Monica," (to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!"
Mike, (doing Monica and mumbling)
Phoebe," (to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back."
[Scene," hotel's bar, Ross and Mr. Oberblau are talking]"
Mr. Oberblau," I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be (pause) just nifty!"
Ross," Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)"
Woman, Jarvis?
Mr. Oberblau," (seeing her) Oh, you're back... (to Ross) this is my wife, Nancy."
Ross, Get Out!
Charlie," Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Ross," Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?"
Charlie," Uh, well... Joey and I broke up."
Ross," Oh my God, wh-what happened?"
Charlie," Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
Ross, I knew that was him!
Charlie," Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best."
Ross," (holding her hand) Hey, you ok?"
Charlie, I guess. There was hum... (she breathes deeply) there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone (pause) else.
Paleontologist," (merrily) Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker."
Ross," Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
Charlie," Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?"
Professore Clerk, Or we could throw you both in now!
Ross," (standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)"
[Scene," game room, Monica and Mike are still playing ping pong]"
Mike," Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
Chandler," (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
Monica," No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
Chandler," Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
Monica, I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Chandler, But...
Monica," Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!"
Chandler, What about the obsessive cleaning?
Monica, That's just good sense!
Monica," (in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)"
Chandler, You ok?
Monica," No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!"
Mike, So you forfeit?
Phoebe, Mike wins?
Monica, I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!
Chandler," No, you didn't."
Monica, What?
Chandler, Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Phoebe, You can't do that!
Mike," Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat."
Phoebe," Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
Monica," (to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this."
Chandler," (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
Monica, But... you suck!
Chandler," (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart."
Chandler," All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."
Mike, Ok!
Monica, Oh my God! You're good!
Phoebe, It's like watching porn!
Chandler, And that's... how... it's done!
Monica, (to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?
Chandler," I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
Monica, Why?
Chandler, I don't know.
Monica, This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Chandler, That's why!
[Scene, Hotel's bar. Ross is running to Charlie trying not to be seen with two cocktails in his hands. She's hidden behind a huge plant]
Charlie, Thanks!
Ross, Hi.
Charlie, Are they still looking for us?
Ross," Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest."
Ross, I don't think they saw us.
Charlie, I don't think they did.
Charlie," Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... (pause) There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else."
Ross, (apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Charlie, I think you know.
Ross," I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
Ross, I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Charlie," All right, all right."
Ross," I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)"
Rachel, What?

Ross, There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under 
Rachel," So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?"
Ross," Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!"
Rachel," Oh my God, what!?"
Ross, Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and 
Rachel," Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground."
Ross, Be-caaauuuse...
Rachel," (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing "
Ross, Seriously?
Rachel," Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden "
Ross, (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you 
Rachel," Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And "
Ross," Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly "
Rachel," Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and "
Ross," Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come "

Monica, Yay!
Chandler, But you already gave all your money to charity!
Phoebe," Well, I’ll just ask for it back!"
Chandler, I don’t think you can do that!
Monica," Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some "
Chandler," That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady."

Phoebe (to Mike)," Gay, go."
Mike (to the charity guy)," Oh my God, I love your shirt!"
Phoebe," The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it "
Charity guy, Excuse me?
Phoebe," Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t "
Charity guy, So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?

Laura, Your place is just lovely.
Monica," Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it."
Laura," You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples "
Monica, Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby 
Chandler," But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
Laura, Oh...
Chandler, What?
Laura, I just realized why I remember this place.
Monica, Really? What is it?
Laura," Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building "

Chandler," Well, we're not."
Joey, But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
Chandler, We don't have a code word.
Joey," We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word "
Monica, So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey

Monica, Hey guys!
Rachel, Hi! 
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, We need to talk to you about something.
Chandler, Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
All, What?
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Are you kidding?
Chandler," Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. "
Ross, (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Chandler," No, no! We made this decision together. "
Ross, She's putting words in your mouth!
Joey," Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!"
Rachel, I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Monica," No, it's not!"
Rachel, It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
Phoebe," Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
Monica," Thank you, Pheebs!"
Phoebe," Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch."
Monica," What? You are way off, lady!"
Phoebe," Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself."
Monica," That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!"
Chandler, Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Monica," Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!"
Chandler, We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
[Scene," Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Monica are in there, and Phoebe enters]"
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe," Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day."
Monica," You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?"
Phoebe, You're not making the pies yourself?
Monica," No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick."
Rachel, Did you at least win the contest?
Monica," 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4."
Rachel, Can't wait!
Monica," This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year ""me""!"
Phoebe, Hey Rach.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, What's Emma doing today?
Rachel," Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?"
Phoebe," Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant."
Rachel, Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Phoebe," Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!"
Rachel," Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!"
Phoebe, (sarcastic) Oh... okay. 
Rachel," Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... "
Rachel, And a thousand dollars.
Rachel," ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important..."
Phoebe," Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition."
Rachel, Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Phoebe," Well, I was thinking..."
Rachel," Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid. "
Phoebe, Yeah!
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is watching TV and Monica is cooking]
Monica, (Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
Chandler, Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Monica, (she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
Chandler," You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
Monica, You don't know that.
Chandler, Somebody is gonna pick us. 
Monica," Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
Chandler," I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!"
Monica, Name one of his books.
Chandler," (after a long pause) ""The Firm""?"
Monica," Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."
Chandler," You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year. "
Monica," Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do."
Chandler," I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
Monica," Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. "
Chandler, Tell me more.
Monica," Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)"
Chandler, You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Ross," Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!"
Joey, Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Ross," Dude, I wanted him to guess."
Joey, Oh.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Joey," Yeah, they're great seats too!"
Ross, Guess where they are?
Joey, Center ice.
Ross, Did I do something to you?
Chandler," Hmm, the game's at one."
Ross, So? 
Chandler," Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
Joey," So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
Chandler," You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
Joey," Dude, two times that happened!"
Chandler," Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
Ross," He's right, man."
Joey," Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four. "
Chandler, Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Joey," That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)"
Ross," We're still going at the game, right?"
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Yeah.
[Scene, Baby beauty contest]
Host," This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca..."
Phoebe, Hey.
Rachel," Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!"
Phoebe," We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!"
Rachel," Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"
Phoebe," Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man."
Rachel," Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!"
Phoebe," (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way! "
Rachel," Phoebe, you have to calm down."
Phoebe," Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!"
Rachel, Really?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, You heard them say that?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel," All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!"
Phoebe, Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Rachel," No, what?"
Phoebe," Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!"
Rachel," No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!"
Phoebe, Why not!
Rachel, Because I already did! 
[Scene, Madison Square Garden]
Joey," Oh, Bob, get off the guy!"
Ross," Oh! What a game, huh?"
Joey," I know, yeah."
Ross, I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Joey," Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair."
Ross," Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away."
Joey, Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Ross," I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!"
Joey," (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."
Ross," Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal."
Joey, I don't know...
Ross, One more fight!
Joey, Okay.
Ross, Okay.
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Monica, Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Chandler, I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
[Scene, The corridor. Ross and Joey have just arrived.]
Joey, How late are we?
Ross, Forty-five minutes.
Joey, Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
Ross, (handing him his coat) Here!
Joey," Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)"
Ross, You may want to lose the foam finger!
Joey," Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!"
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh!
Joey, You are not at Thanksgiving?
Rachel, No... 
Phoebe," No, we're late!"
Rachel, What are you doing here!
Ross, We're late too! (Rachel screams)
Joey, We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
Phoebe," Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!"
Ross," So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!"
Joey," Yeah, where were you!"
Ross," Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!"
Phoebe," Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!"
Rachel, And I won!
Ross, You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Rachel, Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
Ross," Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division."
Rachel, Yeah. That's me!
Ross, You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Phoebe, And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Joey," Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before..."
Ross," I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable! "
Rachel, She won a thousand dollars!
Ross, So this is an annual thing?
Joey, (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Phoebe," You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!"
Ross, Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Rachel," Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap."
Joey," All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae. "
Phoebe," Alright, what are we gonna say?"
Ross," Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!"
Phoebe," Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!"
Joey," No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)"
Ross, (to Joey) HEY!
[Scene, Monica's apartment.]
Monica, Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
Chandler, (peeping) They're out there!
Monica," Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"
Chandler," (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!"
Monica, (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Chandler, (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
Monica, Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Rachel," Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?"
Ross, I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Phoebe, We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this
Ross, (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Rachel," You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)"
Ross, (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
Joey, (whispering) Who do you think its from?
Rachel," Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad."
Ross," Well, let's just go in there and face them."
Phoebe," Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. "
Joey," I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
Rachel," Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused)."
Joey, (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!
Ross, What is that? 
Joey, That's fire. Beats everything.
Phoebe," Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his ""fire"" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out). "
Joey," Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played. "
Rachel," Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time."
All," Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)"
Phoebe, It's locked.
Ross," Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like"
Rachel," Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together."
Monica, No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Chandler," Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?"
Monica, (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
Chandler, (relieved) Oh thank God!
Ross," Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down."
Chandler," (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand."
Ross," (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)"
Rachel," You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)"
Joey, I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)
Monica, That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Ross, How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Joey, (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
Phoebe, What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Rachel," (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning."
Phoebe, Oh yeah!
Monica," Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry."
Chandler," Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)"
Rachel, Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
Ross, That's worse than no food.
Chandler, HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Monica, Stinky?!
Chandler, Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Rachel," Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door."
Phoebe," Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us."
Rachel," You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)"
Joey," (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us."
Ross, I don't know...
Joey, I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.
Ross," (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!"
Rachel, Oh!
Joey, Oh! It all looks so beautiful
Chandler, The cranberries...?
Monica, Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Joey," (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."
Chandler," He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)"
Joey," Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?"
Ross, I feel terrible.
Phoebe and Rachel," So, so sorry."
Joey," (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?"
Chandler, The floating heads do make a good point.
Monica," Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad."
Rachel, So bad.
Ross , So bad.
Phoebe, So bad.
Monica," (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in. "
Rachel, Dessert?
Monica," Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?"
Phoebe," Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica)."
Monica, Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Rachel, Congratulatioooons!
Monica," Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do."
Ross," Really girls, not cool."
Chandler," Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
Joey, Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Ross, It's a day to be thankful.
Joey," (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!"
Monica, It's too late for apologies.
Joey, Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Chandler, That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Rachel," Ewww, is that what that is?"
Joey, Sorry!
Phoebe," Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving."
Rachel, Yeah! I'll cook!
Ross, Yeah! Let's go out.
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Monica, The three of us?
Joey," Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!"
Joey, Ha!
Joey, Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Monica," Joey, that is not gonna work."
Joey, No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Phoebe, I'll pull you through.
Ross, Okay.
Joey, (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Chandler, A little late for that.
Joey," Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something."
Monica," Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face."
Chandler," Uhm, we've got turkey grease."
Monica, Bring it.
Joey, I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Monica, Here you go!
Joey," Oh, that smells good!"
Joey, Okay.
Monica," Okay, try it."
Joey, It isn't working.
Monica," Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain."
Joey," Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!"
Chandler, Can you ever feel your ears?
Joey, Interesting...
Monica," Chandler, where are your tools?"
Chandler," (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!"
Monica," I do, but Rachel borrowed them."
Rachel, I lent them to Ross.
Ross, I gave them to Joey.
Joey, I left them at the park.
Monica, Oh!
Ross, (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Phoebe, I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Ross, Nice!
Monica," Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken."
Joey, It's really starting to hurt.
Chandler," Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!"
Phoebe," Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here."
Joey, Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Chandler," Come on guys, PUSH!"
Joey, Yeah! Come on!
Joey and Chandler, PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Chandler, My cranberries!
Joey," (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me."
Chandler, Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Chandler, (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Monica, (very emotional) I don't care.
Chandler, What's going on?
Monica, That was the adoption agency...
Chandler, And?
Monica, WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Chandler, Are you serious? (they hug)
Monica," There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!"
Rachel, I'm so happy for you!
Monica, This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
[Scene," Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table is set, and there's food on the tables again. They're all there, toasting.]"
Rachel, To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Ross, I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Phoebe, I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Monica," I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)"
Joey," Oh, I know how you feel..."
Rachel, Really?
Joey," Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!"
Chandler, That is the exact same thing.

[Scene, Central Perk. Everyone's sitting on the couch.Monica and Chandler enter]
Chandler,  Hi!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler," We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio."
Phoebe," Oh, right! Your adoption interview!"
Monica," Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby."
Joey," I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!"
Chandler, And so incorrect!
Monica, She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Ross," Come on, she's gonna love you guys!"
Chandler," Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
Monica, And a lot could still get in our way.
Chandler," Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
Phoebe, What are you gonna name the baby?
Chandler, I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Joey," But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?"
Monica, Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Chandler, So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Monica," You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!"
Chandler," Yes, but..."
Monica," Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)"
Chandler," Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"
[Scene, Central Perk. Phoebe's speaking to a girl.]
Rachel," (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?"
Joey, I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, So... who's your friend?
Phoebe," Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!"
Joey," OW, why, why, why?"
Phoebe," Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!"
Joey," Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with."
Phoebe, Mandy.
Joey," Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?"
Phoebe, No.
Joey," I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)"
Rachel, Do you think I'm someone else?
Joey," Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?"
Rachel," Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!"
Joey, (pointing at himself) Growth!
Phoebe," Fine, I'll give you her number."
Joey," Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy."
Phoebe, SARAH!
Joey, Saraaah.
Ross, (entering) Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross," Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice."
Rachel, Oh!
Ross, (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?
Rachel," Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!"
Ross, C'mon! This looks good!
Rachel," Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat."
Ross, Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Phoebe," Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?"
Ross," Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. "
Joey," I can see why, nice shirt!"
Ross, You're wearing the same shirt.
Joey, Stupid Gap on every corner!
[Scene, The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering with a man.]
Agency guy," Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica."
Monica," Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?"
Chandler," Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like"
Monica," Uh, we're gonna be great."
Chandler, You're gonna be great.
Monica, Well... obviously!
Agency guy," (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica."
Monica," Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you."
Erica, (whispering) Hi...
Chandler, Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Erica, Hi.
Agency guy, I'll let you get acquainted.
Chandler, Ok.
Erica," So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D."
Chandler, That's what our friends call us.
Erica," Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating."
Monica, I don't know about that.
Erica," You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?"
Chandler, (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
Monica," (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor."
[Scene, Central Perk]
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe," Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night."
Joey, Well...
Phoebe, Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Joey, Nope.
Phoebe, What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Joey," Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... "
Phoebe," That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!"
Joey," Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent."
Phoebe, What?
Joey, ALL FOOD!
Phoebe," I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!"
Joey," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!"
Phoebe, (to Rachel) Oh
Rachel, Hi
Phoebe, Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
Rachel, what?
Phoebe, Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Rachel," Oh! Oh, no!"
Phoebe, What? You know about the plate thing?
Rachel," Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ..."
Phoebe, (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
Rachel, Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Joey, (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
Phoebe," Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!"
Joey," (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?"
[Scene, A clothes store. Ross and Phoebe are shopping]
Phoebe, (to Ross) This place is awesome!
Ross," You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! "
Rachel," Ah, this place is great!"
Phoebe, Wow!
Ross," Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh)."
Rachel," Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!"
Ross," (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?"
Rachel," Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!"
Ross, Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket)," Hey, check this out! It’s totally you!"
Ross, Wow!
Phoebe, Yeah!
Ross," Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?"
Phoebe, What? They will be!
Ross," All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here."
Rachel," No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants..."
Ross," Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me."
Rachel," Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you."
Ross, Really?
Rachel," Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you."
Ross," So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?"
Rachel, (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
 [Scene, The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.]
Chandler," So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?"
Erica," Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”"
Monica, Amen.
Chandler, Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica," Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands."
Erica," Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?"
Monica, It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica, Wow.
Chandler," Yeah, wow."
Erica, I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica," Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock."
Erica, (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Chandler, No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Agency guy," So, how’s everything going in here?"
Erica," We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions."
Agency guy, Do you have any question for Erica?
Chandler," Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?"
Agency guy," Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it."
Chandler, You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Agency guy," (to Erica) Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk."
Erica," Actually, I don’t think we have to."
Monica, We don’t?
Erica," Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them."
Monica," Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?"
Chandler," Yeah, I did."
Monica," (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!"
 [Scene," Joey’s apartment. Rachel and Phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.]"
Rachel, We got some really great stuff!
Phoebe," Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got."
Rachel, Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
Phoebe," Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?"
Rachel, (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by  
Phoebe," oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later."
 [Scene," Ross walks into Central Perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. Joey is on the couch]"
Ross, (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
Joey, I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Ross, (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Joey," (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that."
Ross," Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?"
Joey, (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross," You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!"
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's hotel room. They enter.]
Chandler, We are NOT signing those papers.
Monica, Why not?
Chandler, It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica, God works in mysterious ways.
Chandler, You have gotta stop!
Monica, But she liked us.
Chandler, She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica," Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)"
Chandler," Your Veal Chop is $34,95!"
Monica," C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now."
Chandler, But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica, (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Chandler, I know..
Monica," I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
Chandler," oh, honey.."
Monica," (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close."
Chandler," Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. "
Monica," (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)"
Chandler," So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
Monica, (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Chandler, You're Jewish.
Monica, Technicality!
[Scene," A restaurant. Joey is on his date with Phoebe’s friend, Sarah. They are sitting opposite each other on a table for two. Their waiter approaches with two plates.]"
Waiter, A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down)
Joey," Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!"
Waiter, Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Sarah," Mmmh, those fries look delicious."
Joey," oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)"
Sarah," (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?"
Joey," Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams."
Joey," How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)"
Sarah," They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)"
Joey," (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?"
Sarah," Oh, that is so sweet.."
Joey," Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)"
Joey, (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!
Sarah, What? what is the matter with you?
Joey," I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?"
Sarah," But you just said ""What's mine is yours""?"
Joey," WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!"
Sarah," Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal."
Joey," I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it). "
[Scene, Ross and his date walk into a lobby. They are both wearing their jackets]
Girl," Wow, this place looks great."
Ross," Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this."
Girl, Me too! (starts to take her coat off)
Ross," Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)"
[Scene, Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands]
Joey," I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you."
Sarah, Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.
Joey," (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams."
Waiter," Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman."
Joey," Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake."
Waiter," Yes, that's Raspberry coule."
Joey," (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to  "
Sarah, (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)
Joey," Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead."
Waiter," Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece."
Sarah, Mmmm! Mmm!
Sarah," Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?"
Joey," Oh yeah, sure. No problem."
Sarah, What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Joey, Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?
Sarah," (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street."
Joey, (laughing) Really?
Sarah, Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)
Joey," Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)"
Joey, (to the torte) Stop staring at me!
Joey," Why, just a tiny little..."
Joey, Oh-oh!
Joey, I'm not even sorry.
[Scene, The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Erica, Hi!
Adoption Agency guy, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Agency guy," So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it."
Monica, (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?
Erica," Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)"
Monica," Look, doctor!"
Agency guy, I don't understand.
Chandler, The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Erica, What?
Agency guy, That's impossible.
Chandler, I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Agency guy, I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Erica, So who are you?
Chandler," Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York."
Monica," Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)"
Erica, So you lied to me before?
Monica," Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend."
Erica, I can't believe this. 
Monica, But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Erica, Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Monica," Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file..."
Erica, I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
Chandler, Erica wait!
Erica, I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)
Chandler, You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica, Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Chandler," Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising."
Erica," Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)"
Chandler," But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?"
Chandler, You still want that baby?
Monica, God bless you Chandler Bing!
[Scene," Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.]"
Ross, Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Joey," (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?"
Ross," Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?"
Joey, Ooh... Not so good.
Ross," Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?"
Joey," Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse."

[Scene, Central Perk. Everybody's sitting on the couch and Monica is eating a chunk of cake.]
Monica, (really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Rachel," My God, get a room!"
Monica, I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Phoebe," If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?"
Monica, (with no hesitation) Sex!
Chandler," (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!"
Monica," Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!"
Chandler, (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
Phoebe," Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?"
Ross, Food.
Phoebe," Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?"
Ross, Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Rachel," Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?"
Joey," Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard."
Rachel," No, you gotta pick one!"
Joey," Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!"
[Scene, Central Perk. Rachel and Phoebe are looking at some photos and they're sitting next to the window.]
Rachel, You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Phoebe," Oh, how cute!"
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe," Oh, she looks just like a little doll!"
Rachel," Oh, no, no. That is a doll."
Phoebe," Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)"
Rachel," Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty."
Phoebe, OH! He's having an affair.
Rachel, He's not having an affair!
Phoebe," You know, I'm always right about these things."
Rachel," No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!"
Phoebe," Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!"
Rachel," Oh, that doesn't mean anything."
Phoebe," Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler) "
Chandler, (picking up the phone) Hello.
Phoebe," Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel."
Chandler," Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
Phoebe," (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember""."
Chandler, Those are all really old!
Phoebe," Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm..."
Rachel," (whispering) ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" "
Phoebe, (glancing at her) What?
Rachel, They're in a caaar...
Phoebe," (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. "
Rachel, Geez!
Phoebe, Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Rachel," Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun."
Phoebe, (patting her bag) I got them!
[Scene, Monica’s apartment. Chandler enters the door.]
Chandler, Hi!
Monica, Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
Chandler, I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica, Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Chandler," Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
Monica, So? What do you think of the house?
Chandler, It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
Monica, Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
Chandler, And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
Monica, Don’t you love the huge yard?
Chandler, And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica," And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!"
Chandler, This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica, So? Do you think we should get it?
Chandler, I don’t know. What do you think?
Monica, I think we should.
Chandler, I do too.
Monica, This is huge!
Chandler, I know.
Monica," How bad you wanna smoke, right now."
Chandler," I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day."
Monica, Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Chandler," We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
Monica, Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler, I know. Gooooood luck with it.
[Scene, Joey’s apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.]
Ross, I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
Rachel," I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!"
Joey," Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!"
Ross," I know, and with the baby coming?"
Phoebe," So, should we tell her?"
Ross," I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?"
Phoebe, Why? Who’d you seen him with?
Ross," No one, I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)"
Phoebe, TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ross," (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!"
Phoebe," All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat."
Ross," Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)"
Phoebe , WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
[Scene, Monica’s apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.]
Rachel," Oh, look at her, so happy!"
Monica, If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Joey," Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?"
Monica," No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?"
Phoebe," Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you."
Monica (puzzled), All right...
Ross, We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Monica, What?
Rachel, Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Phoebe, They went in together. So sorry.
Monica, Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
Phoebe, What?
Joey," (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?"
Monica," Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)"
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!
Chandler," Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
Monica, (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Rachel, Who's Nancy?
Ross, What's going on?
Monica," (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
Chandler, Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Joey, I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Phoebe, Why do you have a realtor?
Monica," Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city."
Joey, (clearly shocked) What?
Rachel, Are you serious?
Monica," When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
Phoebe, So you're gonna move?
Ross, Oh my God.
Joey, Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Rachel," What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!"
Monica," And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
Chandler, ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ross, (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Phoebe," Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?"
Ross," You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
Joey," No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)"
Ross," (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
Chandler," Actually, we already found a house we love."
Ross, What?
Monica," And about an hour ago, we made an offer."
Chandler," Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?"
Ross, You put an offer on a house? 
Monica, (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
Phoebe," Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?"
Chandler, I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Joey," Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can! "
Chandler," (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)"
Monica," We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?"
Rachel, Yeah it is.
Joey, What the hell are you doin'?
Rachel," Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was"
Phoebe," Yeah, but so is this."
Ross," Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?"
Rachel," (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel, Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. 
Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
Ross," That money is mine, Green!"
Rachel," You're fly is open, Geller!"
Phoebe," You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
Chandler," Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Phoebe," [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
Rachel," Ow, that had to hurt!"
Phoebe," Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
The Guys, We will. (they don’t move)
Monica," Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles."
Rachel," No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. "
Monica, Every year.
Joey, (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!
Phoebe, (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey, I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey, It smells really bad in here.
Phoebe," Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!"
Monica," Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?"
Joey, It's Joey.
Monica," I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
Rachel, Oooohh that’s interesting.
Chandler," If you win, we give up the birds."
Joey, (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
Chandler," But if we win, we get your apartment."
Joey, Oooooh!
Monica, Deal!
Ross, What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Joey, Big fat goalie.
Ross, Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Chandler, Dangerous Liaisons.
Ross, Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Joey, Weekend at Bernie’s.
Ross, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Joey, Everyday use.
Chandler, Fancy.
Joey, Guest.
Chandler, Fancy guest.
Ross, Two seconds...
Joey," Uhh, 11!"
Ross," 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) "
Ross, (to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
Rachel, 14?
Ross," No, 19."
Chandler, Thanks man.
Ross, Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Monica, Maurice.
Ross," Correct, his profession was?"
Rachel, Space cowboy!
Ross, Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Rachel, Ow...Oh Gosh!
Ross," 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game."
Monica," It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding."
Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!"
Monica, That’s not even a word!
Monica, NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Rachel," Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!"
Joey," Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!"
Rachel, That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica," Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!"
Rachel," Well it stupid, unfair question!"
Ross, Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler, Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Ross," Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!"
Chandler," (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)"
Monica, (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross, What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel," (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!"
Chandler," Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
Joey, (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Ross," (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!"
Chandler," Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
Monica," I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too."
Ross, (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) 
Monica," Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"""
Rachel," Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler."
Phoebe," Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore."
Monica and Rachel, What?!
Phoebe, You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel," Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving."
Monica," Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like."
Phoebe, What else?
Monica," When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
Rachel," Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that."
Phoebe, That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica," When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket."
Rachel," Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold."
Monica," And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)"
Chandler, (entering) Hey.
Monica, She really left.
Chandler, I know. (He kisses her.)
Monica, Thank you.
Chandler, No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Monica, Can I ask you a question?
Chandler, Sure!
Monica, What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
Chandler," Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
All, That's so sweet.
Ross," And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
Rachel, And a crappy New Year.
Chandler," Here, here!"
[Scene, We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. They're all still at the kitchen table.]
Rachel, You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Joey, Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. 
Phoebe," Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters."
Ross," You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)"
Rachel," Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night."
Chandler," Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
Monica, And?
Chandler," (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price."
Monica, We can't afford that.
Chandler, I know.
Monica," Well, there you go."
Joey, I'm really sorry you guys.
Ross, Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Rachel," Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone."
Phoebe, (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?
Monica," Yeah, we'll be okay."
Ross," Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)"
Joey," You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before."
Chandler," That's okay, we understand."
Joey," And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?"
Monica," I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much."
Chandler," Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then."
Monica, What?
Chandler, We got the house.
Monica, Oh my God!
Chandler, I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Monica, Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Chandler, We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
Monica, And a baby...
Chandler, We're growing up.
Monica, We sure are.
Chandler, So who's gonna tell them?
Monica, (quickly) Not it!
Chandler, Not it! Damn it!
[Scene," Central Perk. The entire gang is there, and Chandler and Monica are handing out presents.]"
Monica," Rachel, this is yours."
Rachel, Aah! Why? What are these for?
Chandler, You'll see.
Monica," All right, everybody open them!"
Rachel, Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
Phoebe, Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
Monica, I know.
Ross, I love this. (he got a sweater)
Joey, A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
Ross," Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?"
Chandler," Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house."
Monica, Enjoy!
Joey," (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?"

Joey, Hey guys!
Monica," Hey, let me tell them!"
Joey, Sure.
Monica, Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Phoebe, Great!
Ross, Really? Which one?
Monica," (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship."
Ross," Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're gonna be on ""Pyramid""!!"
Monica," Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!"
Ross," Except for ""Match game""..."
Monica," Or ""Win, Lose or Draw""."
Chandler, What did I marry into?
Joey, Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Monica," Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party."
Phoebe," Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing."
Ross," Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond."
Joey, Seriously?
Ross, (very excited) Yeah-uh!
Monica, Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler, You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Monica," Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends."
Rachel," Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out."
Monica," (singing) ""I'm a little bit country""..."

[Scene, Class of '91 reunion. Ross and Chandler enter.]
Ross," So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric."
Chandler, Who?
Ross, He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Chandler, (looking around) Did I go to this school?
Ross," Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her."
Chandler," (looks over at her) Sure, nice."
Ross, Dude. You're married to my sister. 
Chandler," You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
Ross," Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?"
Chandler, Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross, Yes please.
Ross," Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!"
Chandler," Awesome, the name really stands out."
Ross," Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!"
Chandler," Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"
Missy, Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross," Hey, Missy..."
Chandler," You know, our band is playing on Friday."

Missy, No way!
Chandler and Ross, Way!
Missy, Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)
Chandler, Fresh!
Ross, Boss!
Chandler, Mint!
Ross, She's gone.
Chandler," I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
Ross," Dude, I was gonna ask her out."
Chandler," I said it first, bro."
Ross," Well, I thought it first, Holmes."
Chandler," (angrily) Look, if you did..."
Ross," Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want."
Chandler, Totally. I had sex in High school...
Ross, Me too. I'm good at it.
Chandler," All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."
Ross, You got it.
Chandler," All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
Ross, Those are the pacts!
Chandler," Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway."
Ross," Oh, oh... maybe not you!"
Chandler," Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact."
Ross," Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?"
Chandler, Your hands are shaking.
Ross," I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)"

Phoebe," Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?"
Rachel, What?
Phoebe," You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about."
Rachel," Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that."
Phoebe," Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!"

Donny," Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator."
Joey," Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points."
Donny, Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
Gene, You put this in your coffee.
Joey, A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Gene, It's white!
Joey," Paper, snow, a ghost! "
Gene, It's heavier then milk!
Joey," A rock, a dog, the earth."
Gene, Pass! 
Gene, You put this on a sandwich.
Joey," Salami, anchovies, jam!"
Gene, It's white!
Joey," Paper, snow, a ghost!"
Gene, It's made from eggs!
Joey, Chickens?
Gene, Pass!
Joey, Oh!
Gene, You put this on a hamburger!
Joey, Ketchup!
Gene, Yes!
Joey, Relish!
Gene, Stop!
Joey, Oh.
Donny," Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there..."
Joey, Yeah...
Donny," Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away."
Stage Manager , And we're out!
Joey," Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?"
Gene," Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!"
Joey," Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!"
Gene," Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you."
Joey," Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!"
[Scene, College reunion party. Ross is talking to Missy.]
Ross," So, Saturday night!"
Missy, I'd love to!
Ross, Great!
Missy, So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ross," Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?"
Missy," Sure, he was in your ""band""? (she air quotes band)"
Ross, It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Missy, Sorry.
Ross," That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
Missy, Really?
Ross," Yeah, why?"
Missy," Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!"
Ross, You did?
Missy, Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Ross, (angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
[Scene, Monica's apartment. The bachelorette party.]
Monica," (to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!"
Rachel," Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!"
Monica, Who is it?
Man, It's the police!
Rachel, (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
Phoebe," (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!"
Man," That's right, it's officer Goodbody."
Monica," What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)"
"Roy, the male stripper"," (coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!"
Roy," Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch."
Monica," Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,..."
Roy, Goodbody!
Monica, ...If-you-say-so. 
Roy, So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
Phoebe," Oh, God!"
Roy," All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right."
Phoebe, Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, Are you kidding?
Rachel," All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!"
Phoebe, How old is your phonebook?
Monica," Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!"
Phoebe," Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!"
Roy, Are you talking about me?
Monica," Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!"
Roy," Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!"
Roy," Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!"
Phoebe, This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Roy," You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!"
Phoebe, Shocking!
Roy," Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!"
Phoebe," Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?"
Rachel," No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!"
Phoebe," No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!"
Roy, Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time! 
Phoebe, I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Roy," Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory."
Phoebe," Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)"
Roy," I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man."
Phoebe," I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
Roy," (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!"
Monica," (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir..."
Roy, Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
[Scene, At Pyramid. Joey is with the woman now.]
Donny," Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill."
Joey, (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
Donny, Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
Joey," Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word"
Henrietta, Uvula!
Joey," Oh, then pass. (Next word"
Donny," O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)"
[Scene," Class of '91 reunion. Ross is walking angrily towards Chandler, who is talking to two other guys.]"
Ross," (To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?"
Chandler, (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross, You broke the pact! 
Chandler," Ross, that was 16 years ago!"
Ross, That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Chandler," I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
Ross, I didn't.
Chandler, Oh really?
Ross, No.
Chandler, Oh really!?
Ross, NO!
Chandler, ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
Adrienne, Yes?
Chandler and Ross, Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
Ross, I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Chandler," Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her."
Ross, I don't know what... you're talking about.
Chandler, Really?
[Flashback scene, 80's College party.] 
 Present Chandler's voice, Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Monica, I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
Rachel, This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Monica," Hey, you've got a boyfriend!"
Rachel," I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)"
Monica," Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!"
Rachel, It... You can so totally tell. 
Monica, I KNOW!
Rachel," Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails)."
Chandler, Aren't you...?
Rachel," Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do)."
Chandler, (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing? 
Rachel, Bitchin'
Chandler, Hi Monica.
Monica, Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
Chandler, O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
Monica, Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Rachel, Oh.
Monica, Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Ross," Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this."
Adrienne," Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this."
Ross, Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
[Scene, We cut back to the present. The reunion where Chandler and Ross are talking.] 
Ross, I didn't know you knew about that.
Chandler," Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song"
Ross, (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.
Chandler, Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Ross," So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even."
Chandler, (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
Ross," We are even, right?"
Chandler," (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?"
Ross, (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
Chandler, Not her!
[Flashback scene," We cut back to the 80's party. Rachel and Monica are ""dancing"".]"
Rachel, I am sooo drunk.
Monica, That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
Chandler, Soo... you girls having fun?
Monica," For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)"
Pizza guy, SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
Monica, Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
Rachel, (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow. 
Chandler, Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Rachel, (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Chandler," Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship."
Rachel," (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers ""Oh my God!"")"
Chandler, So where are you applying to? 
Rachel," Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!"
Chandler, I'm in college and I'm in a band. 
Rachel, (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
[Scene," Monica's apartment. The stripper is sitting at the kitchen table. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe are standing around him]"
Roy, What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
Phoebe," You know, it's fine. We'll pay you."
Roy," No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know."
Rachel," No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?"
Roy, I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel, So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe," Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch."
Roy," You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind."
Phoebe," There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?"
Roy," Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it."
Phoebe, (after a pause) Finish it!
Roy, What?
Phoebe, Your last dance. Do it for us.
Roy, Really?
Rachel, (to Phoebe) Really?
Phoebe," Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time. "
Roy," Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!"
Phoebe, Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Phoebe," Oh no, no, no, don't stop!"
Roy, (out of breath) Have to...
[Scene, The game show studio. Joey and Gene are sitting in the winner circle.]
Donny," Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?"
Joey, (nervously) Yeah...
Gene, (irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
Donny," Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! (runs off)"
Gene," Oak, maple, elm, birch..."
Joey, I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
Gene," Uhm... Buenos días, enchilada, por favor..."
Joey," (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words."
Gene," A match, a candle..."
Joey," Things that go ""tssst"" when you put them out."
Gene," A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm, your pee..."
Joey, Things that burn.
Gene," ""I'd like to go for a walk"", uhm ""scratch my belly""."
Joey," Dude, dude! I think you're losing it."
Gene," Uhm, ""I have fur"", ""I like to bark""."
Joey," Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says."
Gene, Pepperoni...
Joey," (instantly) Pizza toppings, next!"
Gene," Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer..."
Joey," Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)"
Gene," Christie Turlington, Kate Moss..."
Joey, Girls Chandler could never get?
Gene, (irritated) Supermodels!
Joey, Where? (looking around)
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's there and Ross and Chandler walk in.]
Ross," Hey, where's Rachel?"
Monica, She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Ross, Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica, What? When was this?
Ross, Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica, Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler," Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
Ross," Well, it matters to me."
Chandler, Why?
Ross, Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler, You kissed her that night too?
Monica," Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed."
Chandler," Seriously, where did this happen?"
Ross," Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first."
Chandler, Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross, Mine.
Chandler, I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross," No, she was definitely on my bed. "
Chandler," Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
Ross," Well, then who was on my bed?"
Monica," (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)"
Ross," (realizing) NO! No, no!"
Monica," YES! (Chandler gets an ""oh no!"" look on his face)"
Ross, You were under the pile of coats?
Monica, I was the pile of coats!
Ross, OH MY GOD!
Monica, You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross, You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica, You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler, What did I marry into?
[Scene," Back at the party in 1987. People are dancing to ""Disco Inferno"" by The Trammps.]"
Monica," Oh, crap!"

[Scene, Central Perk. Joey's sitting on the couch and Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe," Oh, hey Joey."
Joey," Uh, hey."
Phoebe," Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison."
Joey, (afraid) Yeah.
Phoebe," Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday."
Joey, So he can't come?
Phoebe," No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it."
Joey, Seriously? 
Phoebe," Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom..."
Joey, I am pretty wisdomous.
Phoebe, So... what do you say?
Joey," Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. (they hug)"
Phoebe," Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me."
Joey," (takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
[Scene, Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch. A waitress brings a coffee and Phoebe wants to pay.]
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey," Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this."
Phoebe," (her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me! "
Monica," (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!"
Phoebe," Well, I don't care, so you pick!"
Monica," Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours."
Phoebe, Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Monica, You don't know military time?
Phoebe," Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that."
Monica, Just subtract twelve.
Phoebe," Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and..."
Monica, (screaming) Six o'clock!
Phoebe, Ok.
Monica," Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?"
Phoebe, Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Monica," Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white."
Phoebe, What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica, Ooh... she backed out.
Phoebe, She did? Why?
Monica," I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent."
Phoebe, (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
[Scene, The wedding rehearsal dinner.] 
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler," You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them. "
Phoebe," Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?"
Chandler, No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe, Rehearse it!
Ross, Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
Mike, Thanks for coming you guys.
Ross," Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake."
Mike, Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
Ross, That is why!
Mike, Yeah.
Phoebe, So Rach.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Where is Emma?
Rachel," Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix."
Monica," (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)"
Joey," Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?"
Mike's mother," Yes, we are."
Joey," Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?"
Mike's father, How's that?
Joey," You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go."
Mike's father, Who in God's name are you?
Joey," Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!"
Chandler, (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Ross," Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?"
Rachel, Uh... November?
Ross, I wanna say it's not looking good.
Rachel, Hey Pheebs...
Phoebe, What's up?
Rachel, Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Chandler, Heh.
Phoebe," Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding."
Ross," What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)"
Rachel," Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!"
Phoebe," I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut."
Ross," Oh, man!"
Chandler, This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
Ross, FOOTBALL!
Chandler, Thank you.
Monica," (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it."
Phoebe, Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Monica," Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!"
Phoebe, I don't have a fax machine.
Monica," Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!"
Ross, I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Chandler," I know, I hate being left out of things."
Ross, And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Mike," Hey guys, how is it going?"
Chandler, Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Mike," Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it."
Chandler, What happened?
Ross," Who cares, AND?"
Mike," ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up) "
Ross, I'll do it!
Chandler, (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
Mike, You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Chandler," Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus."
Ross," No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?"
Mike," You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)"
Ross," (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman."
Chandler," Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!"
Ross," Please, you're going down!"
Chandler, You are going downer!
Ross, Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Chandler," (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)"
[Scene, Wedding rehearsal dinner. Joey and Mike are talking.]
Joey," So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?"
Mike," Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that."
Joey," Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?"
Mike, I intend to marry her.
Joey," Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?"
Mike, No more so than acting.
Joey, Strike two!
Mike," You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?"
Joey," Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!"
Ross," So, what did you decide?"
Phoebe, I decided to pee.
Chandler, Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Phoebe," Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!"
Chandler, Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Phoebe," Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today."
Rachel," (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!"
Phoebe," Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that."
Rachel," What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that."
Phoebe," All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid."
Ross, I'll do it! (Monica approaches)
Monica," Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)"
Mike, Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Monica," You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!"
Mike, Is that what you say to Chandler?
Monica," (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)"
Phoebe," Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here..."
Monica (rolling her eyes), oh God.
Phoebe," And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done."
Monica, What?
Phoebe," YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)"
[Scene, Joey's apartment. Joey's having breakfast; Phoebe enters the room carrying her wedding dress.]
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Happy wedding day!
Phoebe," Oh, happy my wedding day to you!"
Rachel," Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages."
Joey," Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages! "
Monica," Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back."
Phoebe," Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid."
Monica," Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)"
Phoebe," Wow, this is a lot!"
Monica," Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine."
Phoebe, You won awards?
Monica, Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hi.
Ross, Where's Rach?
Monica," She's in her room, why?"
Ross," I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking! "
Rachel, What d'you want?
Ross," You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?"
Rachel," Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!"
Ross, I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Rachel," Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!"
Ross," Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!"
Rachel," Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!"
Ross," (waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!"
[Scene," Joey's apartment. Phoebe is talking at the phone, Monica is listening amused.]"
Phoebe, Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins? 
Monica, I know.
Mike, Hey.
Phoebe," Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?"
Mike, (thinks a moment) Orchids?
Phoebe, Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Joey, (to Mike) Hello Michael.
Mike, Joseph.
Joey," May I have a word with you, please?"
Mike, (looking around the room) This is... great...
Joey," Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this. "
Mike, (not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Joey," More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2"
Mike," Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?"
Joey," I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her."
Mike," (gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her. "
Joey," (very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. "
Mike, That must have been one lousy movie.
Joey, (almost crying) That was ME!
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is pacing and Rachel walks in.]
Rachel, Hi
Chandler," Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
Rachel," Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross."
Chandler," Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. "
Rachel," All right fine, I pick you."
Chandler," (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler."
Rachel, (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
[Scene," Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe is on the phone and Monica is nonchalantly ""minding her own business"".]"
Phoebe," No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello? "
Joey, I'm glad we had this little talk.
Mike," Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?"
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Bye.
Mike," Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? "
Phoebe," Oh my God, what's it doing here? "
Monica," (Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle."
Phoebe," (starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me? "
Joey, (staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)
[Scene, Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee at the counter. Chandler walks in.]
Chandler, How's it going? 
Ross, (smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Chandler, (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
Ross," (barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight."
Chandler, You too. 
Ross," Oh, I will."
Chandler, Me too.
Ross," Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you? "
Chandler, I'm not supposed to tell you. 
Ross, I'm not supposed to tell you!
Chandler, You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
Rachel," Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other."
Ross," Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)"
Chandler," Rach, Rach, knock knock."
Rachel, Who's there?
Chandler, I'll tell you at the wedding.
Rachel, Uh.
Mike," Hey, I forgot my scarf. "
Rachel," You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick. "
Mike," Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. "
Ross, What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose. 
Rachel," (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog."
Phoebe," Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!? "
Monica, (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going? 
Phoebe, (to Monica) Help me.
Monica, What? 
Phoebe, I want you to be Crazy Bitch again. 
Monica, (Sounds moved) Really? 
Phoebe, (Nearly in tears) Please? 
Monica, You really want me to come back?
Phoebe, More than I wanna get married.
Monica," Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything."
Joey," Hey, what are you guys gonna do?"
Phoebe, (sounds scared already) About what?
Joey," The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)"
Monica, Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Joey, I don't think they are.
Ross, (to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs. 
[Scene, Monica's apartment. They are all sitting around.]
Monica," (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power."
Joey," Yeah according to the news, most of the city did."
Rachel, Since when do you watch the news? 
Joey," Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl."
Ross, (To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Phoebe, I know.
Rachel," Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?"
Phoebe, What? 
Rachel," Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!"
Phoebe, (Turning to Mike) What do you think? 
Mike, I think I wanna get married to you today. 
Phoebe," Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?"
Monica, (thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!
[Scene," Outside. They are a bunch of people arranging chairs, shoveling snow and making other preparations.]"
Monica," (walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)"
Mike's mom, Michael!
Mike," Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of..."
Mike's mom, No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever. 
Mike's dad," (leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart."
Mike," (to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle."
Chandler," So technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
Mike, I guess.
Chandler and Ross, I'll do it!
Ross," No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?"
Chandler, I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Ross," (takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!"
Monica," Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it."
Mike," Oh, no! "
Joey," Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding."
Monica, Really?
Joey," Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh..."
Ross," Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free."
Joey," I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do."
Monica," Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle."
Chandler, (quickly) I'll do it.
Ross, I'll...
Chandler," (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah..."
Monica," Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)"
Monica," Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away."
Phoebe," Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)"
Monica," So, you're ready to do this?"
Phoebe," Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening."
Rachel," Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)"
Phoebe," Oh, thank you."
Monica," I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)"
Phoebe, I love you guys.
Rachel and Monica, I love you.
Monica, Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Chandler, (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Monica, (checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Chandler, Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
Monica," Okay Marjorie, hit it."
Rachel," Geez Ross, you could have showered."
Ross, It's the dog.
Monica," Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me."
Chandler, Ready?
Phoebe, (nervously) Okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe," Oh wait, oh no. Wait."
Chandler, Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Phoebe, I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Chandler, You look beautiful.
Phoebe, Thank you.
Mike, My God! Aren't you freezing?
Phoebe, Na-ah.
Joey," Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?"
Joey, (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...
Phoebe," When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)"
Mike," Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)"
Phoebe," Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes."
Mike, I love you too. 
Ross, Uh Joey...
Joey, Yeah?
Ross, Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Joey," Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?"
Phoebe, I do.
Joey," Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?"
Mike, I do.
Joey, I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
Phoebe," I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing."
[Scene, The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler and Joey are walking up the stairs.]
Chandler, That really was an incredible wedding.
Joey," It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?"
Chandler," I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
Joey," Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?"
Chandler, I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Ross," Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this."

[Scene, Central Perk. Everyone's sitting on the couch and Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe, Hi
All, Hey! Hi!
Rachel, How was the honeymoon?
Rachel, Oh!
Chandler," So, where's Mike?"
Phoebe," Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!"
Joey," Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help."
Phoebe," Oh, why? What's up?"
Joey," I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in."
Ross," Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé."
Monica," Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?"
Ross, (whispering) It was ok...
Rachel, I did not know you spoke French.
Phoebe," Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?"
Rachel, Oh... you're so sexy!
Joey," Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play."
Phoebe," Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami."
Rachel," Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya."
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's apartment.]
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Why are you wearing my apron?
Monica," I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour."
Chandler," Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?"
Ross, (he enters) Hey. 
Monica, Hey.
Ross, You guys know where Rachel is? 
Monica," No, we haven't seen her since this morning."
Ross, So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey! 
Monica, These are for Erica! 
Ross, What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Monica," Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!"
Ross," So, why is Erica coming to visit?"
Monica," Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building..."
Chandler," Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!"
Monica," Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?"
Ross," (looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!"
Rachel, Ross...
Ross," No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?"
Rachel, My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s. 
Ross, Oh my God.
Monica, Honey.
Chandler, I'm so sorry...
Ross, Is-is he ok?
Rachel," Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated."
Ross," Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now."
Rachel," No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own."
Ross," Still-still, let me come... for me."
Rachel, Ok. If you really need to.
Ross, I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Rachel," Oh, I really could."
Ross, Oh!
Rachel, Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
[Scene," Central Perk. Phoebe's trying to teach Joey French, so she's sitting in front of him with the script in her hands.]"
Phoebe," All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude"", so, just repeat after me. ""Je m'appelle Claude""."
Joey, Je de coup Clow.
Phoebe," Well, just... let's try it again."
Joey, Ok. 
Phoebe, Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey, Je depli mblue.
Phoebe, Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying. 
Joey, Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Phoebe," It does, really?"
Joey, Yeah.
Phoebe," All right, let just try it again. Really listen."
Joey, Got it.
Phoebe, (slowly) Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey, Je te flouppe Fli.
Phoebe," Oh, mon Dieu!"
Joey," Oh, de fuff!"
Monica, (entering with Erica and Chandler) Hey you guys.
Phoebe, Hi!
Joey, Hey.
Monica," I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!"
Phoebe, Oh!
Monica," Joey. Erica, baby!"
Joey, Hi.
Monica," Everyone. Erica, baby!"
Chandler," Monica. Calm, self."
Erica," Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!"
Joey," Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?"
Chandler, Why would you say that?
Phoebe, Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Erica," I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center..."
Joey," Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty."
Erica," Oh yeah, let's do that!"
Chandler, Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
[Scene, Hospital.]
Rachel," (stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green."
Ross, And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Rachel," Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here."
Rachel, Can somebody please go in?
Nurse, Absolutely.
Ross," Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him."
Rachel," Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!"
Ross," I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!"
Nurse," He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out."
Ross, I'm feeling better.
Rachel," Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?"
Nurse," Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him."
Rachel," Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?"
Ross," He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!"
Rachel (leaving), Ok.
Ross, Did the TV wake you?
Dr. Green," No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter."
Ross, Ouchy.
Dr. Green," What are you doing here, Geller?"
Ross," Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) So what's new?"
Dr. Green," Ooh, I have a little heart attack."
Ross," Right, is it painful?"
Dr. Green," What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?"
Dr. Green," So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?"
Ross," Nope, just the one. RACH!"
[Scene, Joey's apartment. Phoebe is trying to teach Joey French.]
Phoebe, Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey, Je do call blue!
Phoebe," Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. ""je""."
Joey, je.
Phoebe, m'ap
Joey, mah
Phoebe, pelle
Joey, pel.
Phoebe," Great, ok faster! ""je"""
Joey, je.
Phoebe, m'ap
Joey, mah
Phoebe, pelle
Joey, pel.
Phoebe, Je m'appelle!
Joey, Me pooh pooh!
Phoebe," Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!"
Joey, What are you doing?
Phoebe," I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. (she leaves)"
Joey, (he goes out calling her) Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! (he gives up). Pooh.
[Scene, Green's mansion. Rachel's Room. Rachel's is combing her hair; Ross's coming into the room] 
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Rachel, Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
Ross," Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great."
Rachel, Oh good.
Ross, Wow.
Rachel, What?
Ross, Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel, What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Ross," Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room."
Rachel," Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name."
Ross, Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross," You had a rough day, uh?"
Rachel," Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!"
Ross," But we do! (pause) It's gonna be ok, Rach!"
Rachel, (she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Ross," What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look..."
Rachel, What?
Ross," They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?"
Rachel," Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?"
Ross," No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest."
Rachel," Ok, maybe you're right."
Ross, (he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
Rachel," Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?"
Ross, Sure!
Rachel, Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
Ross," Oh, of course..."
Rachel, Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Ross, Me too. Come here. (They hug)
Rachel, I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Ross," Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea."
Rachel," Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?"
Ross," No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you."
Rachel," Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
Ross," Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!"
Rachel, Wow. Ok.
Ross, I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).
Rachel, Mhm-mh!
Ross," (outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!"
[Scene, Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica have just arrived.]
Erica, Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Monica," Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming."
Chandler," (enters the room wearing an ""I love New York"" t-shirt, a ""Statue of Liberty"" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!"
Monica, What is with you?
Chandler," Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know."
Monica," Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing."
Erica, Thanks so much for showing me around.
Monica, Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Erica," Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)"
Chandler," Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? "
Erica," Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)"
Chandler, That's great. 
Erica, Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)
Monica, How's that now?
Erica," Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. "
Chandler," So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too? "
Erica," No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)"
Monica, Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)
Erica," No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy. "
Chandler, I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Monica, Are you awake? 
Chandler, Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
Monica," Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy. "
Chandler," Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer."
Monica," Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?"
Chandler, I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is. 
Monica, How? 
Chandler," I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
Monica," Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. "
Chandler," Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
[Scene, Joey's apartment. He is sitting on the barcalounger holding a French study book and listening to a French learning tape.]
Tape," We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq."
Joey," Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!"
Tape, Good job.
Joey, Thank you. 
Phoebe, Hey Joey.
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe," Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again."
Joey," Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!"
Phoebe," Really, can I hear some of it. "
Joey," Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?"
Phoebe," Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH! "
Joey," (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
Phoebe, How could you possibly think that? 
Joey," For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!"
[Scene, The hospital. Rachel is pouring her self a cup of coffee. Ross approaches from behind.]
Ross," Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? "
Rachel," (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)"
Ross, You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay? 
Rachel," Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)"
Ross, You sure you're alright?
Rachel, (coldly) Yep.
Ross," (knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)"
Rachel, FYI..
Ross, (knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
Rachel," In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)"
Ross," (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing."
Rachel," (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
Ross, (acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
Rachel, Oh stop that! 
Ross, I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding. 
Rachel," (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)"
Ross," Hey, I was looking out for you."
Rachel," Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me."
Ross," I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever."
Rachel," Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)"
Ross," Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again."
Rachel, What?
Ross," That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)"
[Scene," Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Erica enter, Chandler is in the kitchen.]"
Chandler, Hey! How was lunch?
Erica," (To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)"
Chandler," (struggling) Oh, really? "
Erica," No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing."
Chandler," O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?"
Monica," Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is."
Chandler," Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it? "
Monica, (smiling) No it's not. 
Chandler, How do you know? 
Erica," Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. "
Chandler, Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Monica, The thing we never do.
Chandler, (nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
[Scene, The theatre where Joey is auditioning. Phoebe enters when Joey's on stage and she sits down. He hasn't seen her.]
Director, Whenever you're ready Joey.
Joey," Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo."
Casting assistant," I'm sorry, what's going on?"
Joey," Dude, come on! French it u-up!"
Director," Joey, do you speak French?"
Joey, Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Director," You know what. I think this audition is over. (Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)"
Phoebe," (in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder."
Director, You really think this man is speaking French?
Joey, Sa-sa-saw!
Phoebe," Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. (Translation"
Phoebe," Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation"
Director," (to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part."
Joey, Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Director, It was great.
Joey, (to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Phoebe, (to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation
Joey, Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
[Scene, Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting at the kitchen counter and Ross enters from Rachel and Emma's room.]
Ross, Emma's down for the night.
Rachel," Oh, good."
Ross, So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Rachel," Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me."
Ross," Oh, no problem."
Rachel," And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again."
Ross, Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Rachel," It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good."
Ross," Yeah... Yeah, that's true."
Rachel," Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?"
Ross," Oh, ye-ah!"
Rachel, You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Ross, ...Valentine's day...
Both," (long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!"
Rachel," Well, I guess that's all in the past, now."
Ross, Hmmm-mmmm.
Rachel, (after a pause) Not even one more time?
Ross, Not even once.
Rachel, No matter how much we want it.
Ross, Even if we want it really bad.
Rachel, That's what we decided.
Ross," Uhm, right!"
Rachel, ...It's kinda hard though!
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel," You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste."
Ross, ...I hate waste.
Rachel, ...Ross?
Ross, Yes?
Rachel, Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
Ross, Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)
[Scene," Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Joey are ""updating"" Joey's resumé.]"
Phoebe," Okay, can you really tapdance?"
Joey, No.
Phoebe, It's off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
Phoebe, Archery?
Joey, No.
Phoebe, Horseback riding?
Joey, Would fall off a lot.
Phoebe, You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey, That I can do.
Phoebe, Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey," All right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?"
Phoebe, Ready... GO!
Phoebe, (checking her watch) You did it!

[Scene, Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are having a diner party with Phoebe and Mike.] 
Mike, (raising his glass) Thank you guys for having us over.
Phoebe," Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night."
Chandler," Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
Monica," Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away."
Chandler," You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)"
Ross," (entering) Hey, you guys... I have great news."
Monica," Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here."
Ross," Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what happened at work today..."
Chandler, A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Ross," Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good."
Phoebe, Wow!
Ross," Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid."
Rachel, (while entering) Hi you guys.
All, Hey.
Rachel," Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate) "
Monica," No one wanted seconds, right?"
Ross," No, no. I-I'm good."
Rachel, Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Ross, I'm up for tenure.
Rachel, Congratulations!
Ross, You too! What are the odds?
Rachel, Ooh! (they hug)
Joey, (enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Monica, I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Phoebe," I do, he's been working on that all day! (looking at Joey)"
[Scene," Central Perk. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler on their couch.] "
Phoebe, Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Monica," No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)"
Phoebe, Where did you go to do it?
Monica, Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Chandler, YOU NEVER DID IT!
Monica, I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Chandler," Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me."
Mike, (walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here you go.
Phoebe," Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?"
Mike," Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it. "
Phoebe," All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan."
Chandler, Mrs Hannigan?
Phoebe," What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it."
Joey, (enters) Hey guys.
Chandler, Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Joey," No, thank you."
Monica," All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."
Chandler," Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city."
Joey," But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map."
Monica," Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us."
Joey," You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!"
Chandler, Damn it.
Monica, See you guys later.
Phoebe, Okay!
Monica, (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Phoebe, Good for you. That was really mature.
Joey," What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here."
Mike, You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Phoebe," Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just... "
Mike, Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Phoebe," All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here."
Joey," Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?"
Joey, I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves)
[Scene, A restaurant. Rachel enters.]
Rachel," (to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing."
Maitre d', Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Rachel, Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Maitre d', I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
Rachel, But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
Maitre d', I know. With Gukki 
Rachel, Sssshhhh!
Mr Zellner, Rachel?
Rachel, Hi... I'm on a date...
Mr Zellner, (confused) That's great!
Rachel," Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there."
Mr Zellner," Well, you got uhm... good energy."
Rachel, Oh.
Mr Campbell, Rachel?
Rachel," Yes, hi!"
Mr Campbell, James Campbell...
Rachel, Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
Mr Campbell, Please... (shows her to sit)
Rachel," Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!"
Mr Campbell, So... your resumé is quite impressive. (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs) 
Rachel, Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
Mr Campbell, Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
Rachel, (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? Huh?
Mr Campbell," Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?"
Rachel, What? I-I don't.
Mr Campbell, You don't?
Rachel," No, I-I-I love it there. "
Mr Campbell," Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?"
Mr Campbell, What?
Mr Campbell, That's Hugo Boss?
[Scene, A  counter at a government building. Phoebe's waiting in line.]
Phoebe, (to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.
Clerk, How can I help you? 
Phoebe," I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun."
Clerk, You need to fill out this form. (motions for the next person in line) 
Phoebe," Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?"
Clerk, It can be anything you want.
Phoebe," Well, not anything, I mean..."
Clerk, Yeah... anything.
Phoebe," Oh, this could take a while."
Clerk, Get out of my line.
Phoebe, Okay.
[Scene, Central Perk. Chandler and Monica are there when Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe," Oh, not anymore. I changed it today."
Monica," Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan."
Phoebe," Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock."
Chandler, That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe, Uh! Princess Consuela.
Monica, You seriously changed your name to that?
Phoebe, Uh-huh! 
Monica," Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?"
Phoebe," Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie."
Chandler," Hey, how'd the interview go?"
Rachel, Oh! It's not good.
Chandler," You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think."
Rachel," Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
Chandler, That is a bad interview.
Phoebe," What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?"
Rachel," Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true. "
Monica, Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Ross," Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? (showing the bottle) Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?"
Phoebe, Ross...
Ross, I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
All (except Rachel), Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)
Ross," This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!"
Gunther, Six? You want me to join you?
Ross," Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. "
Chandler, Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Ross," I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?"
Rachel," Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days."
Ross," Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it."
Phoebe, Can you?
Rachel," Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!"
Ross, And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Phoebe," And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths ""aah"")"
Ross, But also knowing it means a lot.
Monica, But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Ross, ...that center around work.
Chandler, To Ross!
All (except Rachel), Ross!
Ross, You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Phoebe, Oh God!
Ross," No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh, look at you. Look  how happy you are for me."
Rachel," (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job."
Ross," Rach, I'm so sorry."
Rachel, Oh!
Ross, Great. I feel like an idiot.
Rachel," No, it's okay, you didn't know."
Ross, Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's future house. They enter the living room with the realtor and Joey.]
Monica, Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Chandler," And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
Realtor, Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. (she leaves the room) 
Monica," Ah, so glad you decided to come."
Joey," Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus."
Chandler, What?
Joey, Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Monica, No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Joey, Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Monica, Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Joey," Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him) "
Monica, No it's not!
Joey, (squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Chandler," When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
Joey," (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter."
Monica," Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here. "
Joey," FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... "
Monica," Joey, we know that's you."
Joey, no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
[Scene, Phoebe is at Central Perk. Mike enters.]
Mike, Hey (He kisses Phoebe)
Phoebe, Welcome back!
Mike, Ah! I missed you
Phoebe," Oh, me too!"
Mike," So, what's new?"
Phoebe," Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay."
Mike, That's great! You changed you name?
Phoebe, Yes I did! Meet
Mike, (afraid) You're kidding right?
Phoebe, Nope.
Mike, You really did that? 
Phoebe, Yep.
Mike," Yeah, but you can't do that."
Phoebe," Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it."
Mike," (looks at her astonished) Alright, then I'm gonna change my name."
Phoebe," Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?"
Mike, Crap Bag.
Phoebe,(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?
Mike," No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag."
Phoebe," You're not serious, right?"
Mike," Yeah, I'm serious. (sarcastic) It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!"
Phoebe," Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it. "
Mike," I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela."
Phoebe, And I love Crap.
[Scene," Joey is in Monica and Chandler's future house, sitting in a child's bedroom, looking at a quiz card which has ""5+10="" printed on one side.]"
Joey," (turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) Ow!"
Girl, Who are you?
Joey," Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?"
Girl, I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Joey, (understanding) Oh.
Mackenzie, (sighs) I hate my parents.
Joey," I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a pact) Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening."
Mackenzie, Like what? 
Joey," (thinking) Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!"
Mackenzie, What are you? Eight? 
Joey," Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea."
Mackenzie, I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Joey," (frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean? "
Mackenzie, I really don't.
Joey," What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
Mackenzie, My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Joey," Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways."
Mackenzie," This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. (Joey glares at her angrily) Look, you want your friends to be happy, right? "
Joey," Yeah, yeah, I guess."
Mackenzie," Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it? "
Joey," (having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe."
Mackenzie, Then you gotta let them go. 
Joey," (In near tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?"
Mackenzie, I read a lot.
Joey, (his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)
[Scene," Outside Ralph Lauren building. Rachel just walked out carrying a box of her stuff, and a strange man approaches her.]"
Man," Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry."
Rachel," Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)"
Man," You still don't know my name, do you? "
Rachel," (Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)"
Rachel," (annoyed) Ross, what is taking you so long?"
Ross," (stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!"
Mark, Rachel?
Rachel, (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
Mark, How've you been?
Rachel, I'm fantastic. You remember Ross? 
Mark," Sure, sure. (To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)"
Ross," Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly) "
Mark, Clever. (back to Rachel) So how are you?
Rachel," Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day."
Mark," Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion."
Rachel," No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work."
Mark," Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton."
Rachel," Well, screw charity work. What've you got?"
Mark, Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Rachel, Great! I'll call ya!
Mark, (shakes Ross' hand) Nice to see you.
Ross," Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)"
Rachel, (very excited) Oh my God!
Ross, See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Rachel, Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Ross, (realizing) That is Mark?
Rachel, Yes.
Ross, I hate that guy.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross," No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him."
Rachel, What? You don't want me to get a job?
Ross," Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary."
Rachel, Ugh. 
Ross," I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?"
Rachel," Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)"
[Scene," Chandler and Monica's new house. Sitting near the window, they look at the neighborhood.]"
Monica," Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences."
Chandler," Man, those two dogs are going at it!"
Joey, (entering) Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Monica," Hey, where have you been?"
Joey," Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great."
Chandler, Really? What changed your mind?
Joey," Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing."
Chandler," Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
Joey, (frightened) What?
Chandler, Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey, That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Monica," Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?"
Joey, What? I get my own room?
Chandler, You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Joey," Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?"
Chandler and Monica, No!
Joey, Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

Rachel, It's all done!
Monica," Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it."
Rachel," I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane..."
Monica," Ok,  so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?"

Monica, Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Erica, Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Ross," Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product..."

Ross," Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?"
Joey," Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching."
[Scene, Guest room. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.]
Rachel," Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start."
Phoebe," Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you."
Rachel," Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?"
Phoebe," It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!"
Rachel," I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture! "
[Scene, Monica's apartment. The living room.]
Monica, Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.

Monica, What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Chandler," Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!"
Monica," That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before."
Chandler, Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Monica, Rachel used to live in that room.
Chandler, Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)

Ross, (to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
Phoebe, She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Ross, Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Phoebe," Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying."
Ross," Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations."
[Scene, The guest bedroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.]
Rachel," Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me..."
Monica, I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too. 
Rachel," (starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you... "
Monica, (having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.
Rachel, (says something that cannot be understood)
Monica, What? 
Rachel, I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
Monica, That is so sweet. (they hug)
[Scene, Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.]
Ross," (to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing."
Chandler," Uh, Rach?"
Ross, Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her. 
Joey, I really made you think about that thing uh?
Chandler," (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)"
Rachel," (laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get."
Chandler," No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room."
Rachel," Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with..."
Chandler," Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
Rachel," Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room."
Chandler, Pheebs!
Phoebe, (from the other side of the room) Yeah!
Chandler, I think these are yours.
Phoebe," These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice."
Rachel, (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Chandler, Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Phoebe," Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast) "
[Scene, The guest bedroom. Chandler and Rachel.]
Rachel, Oh honey... 
Chandler," Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving."
Rachel," (all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug) "
Chandler," Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance."
Rachel, Okay. Oh...
Rachel, Oh!
Chandler," I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. "
[Scene, Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.]
Monica," (to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?"
Ross, I don't think so. 
Chandler," Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years."
Monica, You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Chandler, That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
Ross, God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long? 
Phoebe," I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well."
All," No, no, no, no!"
Ross," Okay, here we go..."
Rachel, Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...
Ross, Yeah...
Rachel," I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised) "
Ross, Huh?
Rachel," Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night."
Ross, What? I don't get a goodbye? 
Joey, (still very emotional) Lucky bastard!
[Scene," Monica's apartment continued... Phoebe, Chandler, Monica and Joey are sitting down and Ross is pacing up and down.]"
Ross, Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Monica," Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit."
Ross," Well, it needs to be plicit."
Joey," All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad? "
Ross," No, I don't think so."
Phoebe," You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense."
Monica, Yeah. Mine too.
Chandler, Mine was a humdinger  
Ross," (annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)"
Phoebe," Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her."
Monica," And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that."
Ross, THE HELL I DO!
Ross, I don't get a goodbye?
Rachel, What?
Ross," (talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things."
Rachel, Ross...
Ross," Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)"
[Scene, Monica and Chandler's apartment. The others are still there.]
Monica, I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Joey, I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Phoebe, Tell me about it.
Chandler," Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
Phoebe," All right, I think I'm gonna head out."
Monica," Uh, where do you think you're going?"
Phoebe," I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here."
Monica, We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Chandler, Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Joey," Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)"
Monica, Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Chandler, (to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
Monica," Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?"
Phoebe and Joey, Yeah.
Monica," Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong."
Chandler," Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are."
Monica, You did? How?
Chandler," Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used."
Monica, Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
Joey, Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler, Monica's grandmother.
Monica, Nana liked it rough!
Erica, Hi!
All, Hey!
Joey," Come on here, have a seat."
Phoebe, How was your night?
Erica," Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers."
Monica," Erica, are you okay?"
Erica," Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes."
Monica, Oh my God!
Chandler, Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Monica," She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor."
Chandler, Oh my God!
Phoebe," Yeah, you got to get to the hospital."
Monica," All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)"
Chandler," Honey, it's gonna be okay."
Erica, You can do this. Just breathe.
Monica," Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better."
Erica, (in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?
Monica," Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone."
Joey," Chandler, wait, wait, wait..."
Chandler, What?
Joey," If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger."
[Scene, Ross's apartment. Rachel bursts in.]
Rachel, You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross, That's what it seemed like.
Rachel," I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me."
Ross," Fine, then why didn't you say something?"
Rachel," Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!"
Ross, Rach!
Rachel, What?
Ross," You keep, you keep... You can't..."
Rachel, WHAT?
[Scene, Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Joey, A little more.
Phoebe, Okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)
Joey," A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this."
Phoebe," All right, ready?"
Joey," Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot."
Phoebe," All right, here it goes..."
Joey, (in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)

Joey," Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."
Chandler," Joey, wait! The ball!"
Joey, Oh!
Joey, Oh God! So what do we do?
Chandler, I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Joey, Okay.
Chandler, No... It's all glued together.
Joey, Does that mean we have to bust it open?
